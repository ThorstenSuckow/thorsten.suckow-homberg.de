# A Brief Overview on Recent Cyberattacks (early 2025)

In the first months of 2025, several high-impact cyberattacks made headlines - targeting everything from crypto exchanges and streaming platforms to core infrastructure components. This post takes a brief look at two selected incidents: How they worked, what security objectives were compromised, and what they reveal about the evolving threat landscape.

<!--truncate-->


We begin with a list of notable incidents:

- **Bybit Hack**<br />
In February 2025, the cryptocurrency exchange *Bybit*[^bybit] became the victim of a hack in which over \$1.5 billion were stolen by North Korean hackers[^fbi-psa].

- **Storm-0408**<br />
In March 2025, Microsoft reported a malware campaign[^microsoft] targeting users via (illegal) streaming websites. Malicious advertisements embedded in these websites installed information-stealing malware on users' devices.

- **DDoS Attack on X.com**<br />
In March 2025, Wired.com[^wired] reported a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack targeting X.com (formerly twitter.com).


- **Fortinet Zero-Day Exploit**<br />
In January 2025, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)[^fortinet-bsi] published a warning regarding a zero-day vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy. Attackers could exploit the flaw to obtain super-admin privileges.

- **Security Risk from End-of-Life MS Exchange Versions**<br />
In March 2025, the BSI[^exchange-bsi] warned of security vulnerabilities in versions of Microsoft Exchange Server that have reached *end-of-life* status but are still in use by various institutions.

## DDoS Attack on X.com

- **Affected <Wiki name="security objectives" file="csec.ciatriad" />:** **Availability** (**Mitigation measures:** Including **decoupling**, **scalable infrastructure**, and **IPS**[^ips])

X.com relies on the services of Cloudflare[^cloudflare] to protect itself against DDoS attacks[^dns-lookup].
DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service) aim to flood a service with excessive requests until the system's technical resources are exhausted and no further requests can be handled (cf. <Cite pp="120 ff." name="Eck23" />, <Cite pp="533 ff." name="SL05" />).
A major challenge lies in distinguishing legitimate from malicious requests, as the traffic is distributed across various IP networks. It is therefore difficult to attribute the attack to a single source.


As a result, many organizations rely on service providers with the technical capabilities to operate large-scale server infrastructures that are specifically designed to mitigate such attacks.
For institutions to implement such defenses on their own would typically require considerable staffing and technical resources.

Wired.com quotes **Kevin Beaumont**[^beaumont], who describes the botnet used in this case as being composed of cameras and DVRs - in other words, IoT devices that are often insufficiently protected from a security standpoint, as also noted by *Münch and Schaumüller-Bichl* (<Cite pp="36" name="ITS2" />).

In this instance, the vulnerability seems to have been exacerbated by the fact that some of X.com's services were not protected by Cloudflare's infrastructure:

> “[…] some X origin servers, which respond to web requests, weren't properly secured behind the company's Cloudflare DDoS protection and were publicly visible.”


[^ips]: *Intrusion Prevention System* - a system that analyzes network traffic using Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) to detect various forms of attack.

[^dns-lookup]: As noted in the article cited above; further evidence includes DNS requests showing A-records pointing to Cloudflare IP addresses such as 172.66.0.227 (retrieved 23.03.2025)

## Bybit Hack

- **Affected <Wiki name="security objectives" file="csec.ciatriad" />:** **Authenticity**, **Integrity**, **Confidentiality** (**Mitigation measures:** Diverse and not reducible to a few isolated mechanisms.)

Nearly USD 1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency *Ethereum* were stolen in the attack.
The North Korean hacker group *Lazarus*[^lazarus] was identified as responsible.

The theft was likely enabled by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying key infrastructure. In *multisignature wallets*[^multisig], several users must provide their private keys to authorize a transaction.
Owners of crypto assets using wallets protected by a single private key are often targets of phishing attacks aiming to drain their funds.
To counter this, multisig wallets - where multiple private keys are required - serve as a **preventive security measure**.

In this case, both social engineering and infrastructural weaknesses at *Safe\{Wallet\}*[^safe-wallet], a third-party multisig provider, were exploited.
The attackers first performed test transactions with smaller amounts to verify the vulnerability, before eventually stealing large sums.

The hackers used a compromised laptop belonging to a *Safe\{Wallet\}* developer and obtained AWS tokens to bypass **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**. This enabled them to install malware on a server[^hackernews].

> “All signers saw the masked UI which showed the correct address and the URL was from
> @safe [Note: *Safe\{Wallet\}*]. However, the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of our ETH cold wallet.”
>  -  [@gauthamzzz on X](https://x.com/gauthamzzz/status/1893004650934345889)[^gauthamzzz]

The theft was carried out through a manipulated multisig wallet user interface. Victims unknowingly signed transactions that compromised their **cold wallet**[^cold-wallet] (offline wallet including private keys).
These offline wallets were then used to legally initiate transfers to shadow wallets - without the users’ intent.

The affected security objective **confidentiality** likely resulted from **human error**, ultimately exploited via social engineering.

This incident highlights fundamental security challenges in cryptocurrency trading. As noted in the closing remarks of *The Hacker News* article:

> “Verifying that the transaction you are signing will result in the intended outcome remains one of the biggest security challenges in Web3, and this is not just a user and education problem  -  it is an industry-wide issue that demands collective action.”

## Model Matrix

#### Rotation: World vs. Local Origin

In my latest [article](/docs/articles/computer-graphics/model-matrix-rotation-world-vs-local-origin), I introduce the mathematical foundation for rotation as linear transformations applied to model matrices in 3D computer graphics. The article focuses on the distinction between rotating an object around an external point and rotating it around its own local origin, and derives the necessary transformations from two conceptually different but mathematically equivalent perspectives: Active transformations and passive transformations.

 The article also demonstrates the impact of matrix multiplication order, distinguish between world-space and local-space rotations, and concludes with performance considerations and examples from external libraries and game frameworks.

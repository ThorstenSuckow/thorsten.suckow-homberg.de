## Releasing conjoon 1.0.0-beta.0

ðŸŽ‰ 5 years after the (almost) [first commit](https://github.com/conjoon/conjoon/commit/ca075e548a644011e0d9fbaa3321bcff7aa8f998) to conjoonâ€™s [new home](https://github.com/conjoon/conjoon), Iâ€™m happy to announce the immediate availability of the first public pre-release of [**conjoon](https://conjoon.org)**, an open source email client built with JavaScript, PHP and great tools from the open source community.

To install the latest release on your local machine, type

```bash
$ npx create-conjoon@latest
```

then follow the instructions on screen.

Donâ€™t miss out on the [documentation](https://www.conjoon.org/docs) for more information about available install and build types.

While Iâ€™m confident that conjoon can take its first steps in a production environment, expect a stable first release to be available in the coming days. Until then, a few additions to the documentation and the [guides](https://www.conjoon.org/docs/category/guides) will be made.

Happy coding! ðŸŽˆ

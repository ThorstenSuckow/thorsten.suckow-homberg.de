## The Geometry of the Dot Product

#### ... and Applications to Visibility Modeling

The Dot Product is a fundamental building block for vector operations in games and simulations. A solid understanding  is crucial for applications involving view-related coordinate transformations and even physical modeling within a game world. For many practical use cases, the dot product offers an elegant alternative to constructing explicit visibility cones or relying on computationally expensive raytracing algorithms.

My [article](/docs/articles/computer-graphics/dot-product) provides an introductory exploration of the theory of the dot product and its geometric interpretation.

An example involving field-of-view-calculations illustrates how the dot product can simplify visibility modeling and decision-making in games.

Additional proofs establish key lemmas that support further applications of the dot product and related operations in both 2D and 3D.

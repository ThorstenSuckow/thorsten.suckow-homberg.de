## Finding Hamilton Cycles in Graphs


## Notation

1. $[M]^k$ is the set of all subsets of M such that $\forall E \in [M]^k: |E| = k$.
1. $G$ is a $Graph$.
2. A $Graph$ is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of disjoint sets such that $E \subseteq [V]^2$. Elements of $V$ are called _vertices_, elements of $E$ are called _edges_.
3. $v \in G$ is a _vertex_ (or _node_) of $G$, $e \in G$ is an _edge_ of $G$.
4. $V(G)$ is the set of all _vertices_ (or _nodes_) of $G$, $E(G)$ is the set of all _edges_ of $G$.
4. $\emptyset$ is an _empty Graph_ $(\emptyset, \emptyset)$. 
5. A _finite_ Graph is a Graph whose set of _nodes_ are finite. This article treats _finite_ Graphs.
6. The _degree_ $d(v)$ of a _vertex_ is the number of _edges_ at $v$. A _node_ $v \in G$ with $d(v) = 0$ is _isolated_.
7. The _order_ of a Graph is the sum of it's nodes $G(V)$, also denoted by $|G|$.
8. The number of _edges_ $|E(G)|$ in a graph is denoted by $||G||$
8. The <GlosRef name="Spanning Tree" file="graphtheory.spanningtree" /> $T$ of $G$ is a _minimal connected graph_ with $G(V) = G(T)$ and $E(T) \sube E(G)$
9. A _path_ is a non-empty $Graph$ $P = (V, E)$ such that $V = \{x_0, x_1, ..., x_k\}$ and $E=\{x_0x_1, x_1x_2, ..., x_{k-1}x_k\}$. $P$ connects $x_0$ and $x_k$ (the _ends_ of $P$). If $P \sube G$, $P$ is a _path_ in $G$.
10. If $P = x_0x_1, ... , x_{k-1}$ and $k \ge 3$, then $C:= P + x_{k-1}x_0$ is called a _cycle_.

## Hamilton cycle

A _Hamilton cycle_ of $C \sube G$ is a _cycle_ that contains every _vertex_ of $G$: $|G| = |GÂ´|$ exactly once.

## Algorithm

We will show that the following algorithm is suited to decide whether a (perhaps empty) $Graph$ contains an **Hamilton Path**.

### Prerequisites
In the following, we assume that the following prerequisites were examined before the algorithm is executed:

1. $\emptyset$ contains no **Hamilton Path**. This check can be done in $\Omicron(1)$.
2. A $Graph$ $G$ that contains an _isolated node_ contains no **Hamilton Path**. This check can be done in  $\Omicron(n)$, with $n = |G|$

## Introduction

This article describes one of the final steps in the rendering pipeline: Projection and perspective transformations.

While in perspective projection all projection lines converge at a single point - producing the familiar sense of depth—in orthographic projection these lines run parallel to each other. With this projection type, parallel lines therefore remain parallel even after mapping onto the so-called unit cube.

We begin with the orthographic projection and derive a projection matrix that maps an arbitrary view volume onto the so-called unit cube. Along the way, we use figures and an interactive application to show how an orthographic projection affects objects we usually perceive in a perspective manner.

We then derive the perspective projection and show how choosing a near and a far viewing plane, as well as a height and a width, creates a so-called view frustum that contains the objects visible to the observer. All remaining objects in the world are ignored in the subsequent projection.

The article concludes by summarizing the OpenGL rendering pipeline and closing with a brief derivation of the transformation into normalized device coordinates (NDC) of the perspective projection.



## Projection Planes

In the final steps of the rendering pipeline, the _perspective divide_ converts clip-space coordinates to _normalized device coordinates_[^ndc]; the _viewport transform_ maps them to screen space, and _rasterization_ produces the 2D image.

[^ndc]: A common stumbling block when you’re used to absolute screen pixels: How are you supposed to scale anything when there’s "nothing" to scale against?

Before this happens, a view matrix $\boldsymbol{M}_\text{lookAt}$ is constructed that transforms world coordinates into camera coordinates, defined by a vantage point $\text{eye}_{xyz}$, the observed point  $c$ and a vector  $\vec{up}$  representing the camera’s up direction at camera at $\text{eye}_{xyz}$ looking at $c$.

Transforming world into camera coordinates isn’t particularly helpful on its own. In a scene graph with hundreds of nodes, we still have to decide which ones should actually appear on screen. Even if we know the viewer’s position and look direction, using a single point as render input yields an almost empty image. And approximating a point cloud with only the device’s height and width doesn’t suffice: it may hint at the aspect ratio, but it tells us nothing about scaling, depth range, or clipping.

In general, the camera implicit in computing camera coordinates is a pinhole camera - an idealized model with an infinitesimally small aperture that admits rays and produces an image. We push the abstraction a step further: in computer graphics we don’t capture photons, we trace geometric lines from the scene’s vertices through the pinhole onto a projection plane. If you like the _camera obscura_[^cameraobscura] picture: place a screen behind the pinhole and the projected points meet on that plane, yielding a mirrored, upside-down image (see <Figure idx={figures.camera_obscura} />).

However, our projection plane is in front of us. In the following, we’ll determine its size, its distance from our position, and which scene objects fall into the resulting <Wiki name="view frustum" file="computergraphics.viewfrustum" />

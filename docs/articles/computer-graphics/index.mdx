:::caution Notation

- We will use _exponent notation_ to abbreviate the dot product of a vector with itself , i.e.

$$
\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} = |\vec{v}|^2
$$

- Where appropriate, for any vector $\vec{x}$ with $|\vec{x}| = 1$, we will alternatively use _hat_ notation, $\hat{x}$, to explicitly indicate that we're dealing with a unit vector.

- We will use _column-based_ notation for vectors. Row-vectors will be specified as **transposed** column vectors, e.g.
$$
(1, 2)^T = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

An expression such as $\vec{v}^T$ denotes the transpose of vector $\vec{v}$:

$$
\vec{v}^T = (\vec{v}_x, \vec{v}_y)
$$


- The identity matrix is represented by the symbol $\boldsymbol{I}$. If not immediately clear from the context, we will make use of the dimension as the subsript, e.g.   $\boldsymbol{I}_2$ for the identity matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.

- **cw** and **ccw** may be used to denote rotations in **clockwise** and **counterclockwise** directions, respectively

title: "Creating Ext JS Applications with coon.js"
description: Ext JS Application Development with npm and pluggable Packages   
---

This is an article series on [coon.js](http://github.com/coon-js), a framework for rapid Ext JS Application building
with the help of pluggable packages and instance configurations.

A lot of the tools and functionality was implemented in and refactored from [conjoon](/projects#conjoon) into this
project. Some more side projects have evolved over the time from this, such as [delorean](../sencha-extjs-beyond-es5/index.mdx) or a
[Dependency Injection Container](../dependency-injection-in-javascript/index.mdx) to replace the [Service Locator](./4-registering-services-and-using-the-service-locator.mdx): Both articles can be found under their given url and are not part of this particular article series.

    This report investigates the time complexity of the Shellsort algorithm , based on both empirical measurements and formal analysis, with a particular focus on key arrangements that lead to worst-case behavior.

    Using a classic increment sequence of the form $h_t = \lfloor \frac{n}{2^t} \rfloor$, we analyze the number of element comparisons and swaps during the sorting process. Empirical data suggests a runtime between $O(n\ \log\ n)$ and $O(n^{1.3})$, while worst case-conditions yield a theoretical bound of $O(n^2)$. The report includes step-by-step code analysis and provides visual illustrations of best and worst-case inputs.

The Payroll System was introduced in Robert C. Martins Book **Agile Software Development** [**[ASD]**](/docs/bibliography#asd)  and describes a batch Payroll System.

In preparation of Section 3 and its subsequent chapters of the book, I decided to implement the Use Cases following agile principles and compare then later on with the solution provided by Robert.

## A brief description of the Payroll System
1. The system consists of a database of the _Employees_ and their associated data.
3. The system must pay each _Employee_: 
   1. The correct amount has to be paid.
   2. The _Employee_ must be paid on time.
   3. The _Employee_ must be paid by the method they specify. 
   4. Various deductions must be taken from the _Employee_'s pay. 

The following technical- and (non)-functional-criteria can be observed from this introduction: The database tells us that data needs to be persisted by the application.
A **functional criteria** would be correct payment considering various deductions, and a **non-functional criteria** would be the fact that _Employees_ must be paid on time: It involves functional criteria in the form of "the system must compute the date **when** an _Employee_ gets paid", but it also includes non-functional criteria: The system must be stable and highly available to make sure transactions (i.e. money transfer) are executed on time.

### Domain keywords
To get a better understanding of the domain we're dealing with, let's extract and guess a few domain keywords that we're probably using throughout the project and which should become terms of the <GlosRef name="Ubiquitous Language" file="ddd.ubiquitouslanguage" /> we're establishing for the project:

 - Payroll, Employee, Payment, Salary, Deduction, Accounting

Since we're implementing a Payroll System, the system will be part of an **Accounting Domain**. Let's see if we can get a grasp of a more specific <GlosRef name="Core Domain" file="ddd.coredomain" /> during the course of the implementation.

## The rules
I stick to the following rules while implementing my solution with the knowledge I have from the brief introduction of the system

1. One Use Case equals one sprint.
2. [Pragmatism over Dogmatism.](https://twitter.com/home)
3. Implement the Use case given only the information the Use Case provide. A Use Case represents a Story that has to be implemented in _this_ sprint. There is no knowledge of the requirements given _future_ Use Cases.
3. Establish a healthy code base with a test-first approach. 
4. Avoid <GlosRef name="Needless Complexity" file="sd.symptomsofpoordesign" /> by strictly following Rules 2, 3 and 4.

### A note on testing 
1. There is not a scripting system for the acceptance tests: The acceptance tests described with the Use Cases are written
with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).

2. I consider the inputs defined with the acceptance tests as an important requirement for the user interface. The user
interface will be leveraged to the testing environment.

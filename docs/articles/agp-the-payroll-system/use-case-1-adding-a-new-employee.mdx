# Use Case 1 - Adding a new employee

:::info Use Case 1 - Adding a new employee
_A new employee is added by the receipt of an `AddEmp` transaction. This transaction contains the employee's name, addess, and assigned employee number. The transaction has the following three forms:_

```bash
$ AddEmp <EmpId> "<name>" "<address>" H <hourly-rate>

$ AddEmp <EmpId> "<name>" "<address>" S <monthly-salary>

$ AddEmp <EmpId> "<name>" "<address>" C <monthly-salary> <commission-rate>
```

The employee's record is created with its field assigned appropriately.

**Alternative:<br />
An error in the transaction structure**<br />
If the transaction structure is inappropriate, it is printed out in an error message, and no action is taken.
:::

## Requirement Analysis
The Use Case describes various ways how _Employee_-data can be added to the system.
`AddEmp` could be implemented as a polyadic function that receives 5-6 arguments,
describing an _Employee_'s personal information and the salary the _Employee_receives, and
the type of _salary_ (`H`, `S` or `C`). If the salary type is `C`, an _Employee_ requires an additional `commission-rate`.
Obviously, errors happening during transactions must be treated with care, appropriate error messages should be displayed.
This is particularly important for the input provided by the client, e.g. salary types must be validated as well as the
rates; also, check if `empId`s already exist and prevent multiple occurences of the same `empId`.

#### Takeaways
 - validate user input:
    - `empId`: existing? valid format?
    - `salaryType`: is it one of `H`, `C`, `S`?
    - `salary` should be greater than `0`
 - display error messages if a transaction failed

### Actors
**Accountant** - adds a new _Employee_ to the system.

The <GlosRef name="Actor" file="uml.actor" /> carrying out the <GlosRef name="Use Case" file="uml.usecase" /> is an **Accountant**. Of course,
any other "role" would be eligible, but since the system exists in a <GlosRef name="Domain" file="sd.domain" /> dealing with
_Accounting_, I assume **Accountant** describes (a part of the) target audience of the system quite well.

## Specifications
 - For $n \in \N_0$, $S_n$ is a set of arbitrary characters $|S_n|=n$. Then `""`=$S_0$, an empty `string`.
 - "empId" $\in S_{n>0}$
 - "salary type" $\in \{"H", "C", "S"\}$
 - "salary type" $= "C" \rArr$ `<commission-rate>` $\in \R_{\ge0}$
 - "rate" $\in \{x=$ `<hourly-rate>` $\lor \space x=$ `<monthly-salary>` $| \space x \in \R_{\ge0}\}$


## Design
 The main program receives the input and forwards it to the <GlosRef name="Application Layer" file="sd.applicationlayer" />. A <GlosRef name="Repository" file="sd.repository" /> manages transaction-calls for an `Employee`-<GlosRef name="Entity" file="sd.entity" />. This will be orchestrated by `Payroll`,
a **<GlosRef name="Domain Model" file="ddd.domainmodel"/>** part of the **Domain Layer**.

### Domain Objects
 - The `Employee`-**Entity** providing information about `salary`, `salary-type` etc.
 - The `EmployeeRepository` accesses the required infrastructure for persisting `Employee`-Entities. The Repository should give the client the illusion that objects queried from it are in memory <BibRef name="DDD" pp="157" />. Thus, the reconstitution as well as the creation of `Employee`-instances will be delegated to a <GlosRef name="Factory Method" file="sd.factroymethod" /> as part of the `Employee`-class. At this point, I do not see the need for a more complex factory that assembles intricate <GlosRef name="aggregates" file="ddd.aggregate" />, but providing a **Factory Method** as part of this **Domain Object** (and **Domain Objects** in general) can help with leveraging responsibilities for constructing and reconstitution of said **Domain Objects** to the **Domain Object** itself <BibRef name="DDD" pp="139" />.  Following the <GlosRef name="Dependency Inversion Principle" file="sd.dependencyinversionprinciple" />, the `EmployeeRepository` will provide the **Interface** to which the object in the Infrastructure Layer has to conform to.

### Layers

#### Client Layer
 - We will receive input from here. This layer will be substituted by the test classes

#### Application Layer
 - Will consume the input and forward it to the **Domain Layer**. This layer will be substituted by the test classes. Thus, the test cases replace the controller method. It will accepts primitive data types which are forwarded to the `Employee`'s **Factory Method**. `Employee`-instances will be forwarded to the `Payroll`'s `addEmployee`-method

#### Domain Layer
 - `Payroll` exists in the **Domain Layer** in the form of a <GlosRef name="Facade" file="sd.facade" />.
 - The `EmployeeRepository` handles **Domain Objects** so it's associated with **_this_** domain and will a such become part of the **Domain Layer**.

#### Infrastructure Layer
 - The `EmployeeRepository` accesses lower-level objects facilitating `write`-operations for a data storage of an arbitrary type. The lower-level objects
will be part of **_this_** layer. For this implementation, we will focus on the interface and provide simple file-based operations, but implement a <GlosRef name="Table Data Gateway" file="sd.tabledatagateway" /> that provides access to `Employee`-data. The **Domain Layer** will provide the interface for such an `EmployeeGateway` according to the <GlosRef name="Dependency-Inversion Principle" file="sd.dependencyinversionprinciple" />.

<TabItem value="employee_desc" label="The Employee.">

I have deliberately put the `Employee` into the `Company` namespace. According to the [description of the software](/docs/articles/agp-the-payroll-system/introduction#a-brief-description-of-the-payroll-system),
the `Payroll`-system will make sure to pay an `Employee` - and I see an `Employee` in the context of a **Company**, although putting `Employee` into the `Company`-namespace hints to resembling a parent("company")-child("employee") relationship. Such namespaces often share symptoms of vacuous modelling - just like an <GlosRef name="Anemic Domain Model" file="ddd.anemicdomainmodel" /> is of little functional and conceptual value. In general, [Vernon](https://vaughnvernon.com/) suggests to _"relax the rules a bit between child and parent Modules."_ <BibRef name="IDDD" pp="334" />.

Even if the Use Case does not explicitly state such a context, at least the semantics indicate it. Is `Company` then eligible to understand the context of `Employee`? Not necessarily. But the discussion should be held with domain experts understanding the project to the fullest. Is the Software used with **Public Administrations**? Then **Company** might not be the best fit for the managed `Employee`.

# Use Case 1 - Adding a new employee.

:::info Use Case 1 - Adding a new employee
_A new employee is added by the receipt of an `AddEmp` transaction. This transaction contains the employee's name, addess, and assigned employee number. The transaction has the following three forms:_

```bash
$ AddEmp <EmpId> "<name>" "<address>" "<address>" H <hourly-rate>

$ AddEmp <EmpId> "<name>" "<address>" "<address>" S <monthly-salary>

$ AddEmp <EmpId> "<name>" "<address>" "<address>" C <hourly-rate> <commission-rate>
```

The employee's record is created with its field assigned appropriately.

**Alternative:<br />
An error in the transaction structure**<br />
If the transaction structure is inappropriate, it is printed out in an error message, and no action is taken.
:::

## Requirement Analysis 
The Use Case describes various ways how _Employee_-data can be added to the system.
`AddEmp` could be implemented as a polyadic function that receives 6 to 7 arguments, 
describing an _Employee_'s personal information and the salary the _Employee_receives, and
the type of _salary_ (`H`, `S` or `C`). If the salary type is `C`, an _Employee_ requires an additional `commission-rate`. 
Obviously, errors happening during transactions must be treated with care, appropriate error messages should be displayed.
This is particularly important for the input provided by the client, e.g. salary types must be validated as well as the
rates; also, check if `empId`s already exist and prevent multiple occurences of the same `empId`.

#### Takeaways
 - validate user input:
    - `empId`: existing? valid format?
    - `salaryType`: is it one of `H`, `C`, `S`?
    - `salary` should probably be greater than `0`
 - display error messages if a transaction failed

### Actors 
**Accountant** - adds a new _Employee_ to the system.

import Actor from './img/usecase1/actor.svg';
import {Embed} from "../../src/components/Embed";

<Embed
    title={"Actor \"Accountant\" carries out the \"Add Employee\"-Use Case."}
>
    <Actor />
</Embed>

The <GlosRef name="Actor" file="uml.actor" /> carrying out the <GlosRef name="Use Case" file="uml.usecase" /> is an **Accountant**. Of course,
any other "role" would be eligible, but since the system exists in a [Domain](../Glossary/softwaredesign.domain) dealing with
_Accounting_, I assume **Accountant** describes (a part of the) target audience of the system quite well.

## Design
The initial design should consist of 3 parts: An **Application Layer**, a **Repository** for managing transaction-calls
and an `Employee`-<GlosRef name="Entity" file="sd.entity" />.
 - `Payroll` exists in the **Application Layer** and is the main entry point for interacting with the system, in the form
    of a traditional <GlosRef name="Facade" file="sd.facade" />.
 - The <GlosRef name="Repository" file="sd.repository" /> would be the `EmployeeRepository` and encapsulates the
    required infrastructure for persisting `Employee`-**Entity**s.
 - The **Entity** would be the `Employee` itself.

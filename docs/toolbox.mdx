# Catalogue

This catalogue shows some tools of my ever-growing toolbox.

You will find hammers, chisels, brushes, rulers and measuring tape in here: Some are used to scrutinize
and identify initial shapes, some help with getting those into form. Others help with precisely carving out finer details.

This is the more formal section of my site: For musing and general ideas, have a look at my
[Articles on Software Development](/docs/articles/index.mdx) and my [Blog](/blog).


```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

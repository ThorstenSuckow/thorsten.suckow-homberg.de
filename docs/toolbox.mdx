# Catalogue

This catalogue shows some tools of my ever-growing toolbox.

You will find hammers, chisels, brushes, rulers and measuring tape in here: Some are used to scrutinize
and identify initial shapes, some help with getting those into form. Others help with precisely carving out finer details.
Some serve to memorize those details.

This is the more formal section of my site: For musings and general ideas, feel free to explore my
[articles](/docs/articles/index.mdx) and my [blog](/blog).


```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

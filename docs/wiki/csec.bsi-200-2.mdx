# BSI-Standard 200-2: IT-Grundschutz-Methodology

The BSI-Standard 200-2[^sources] provides a methodology for the effective implementation and management of information security.
The standard complements <Wiki name="BSI-Standard 200-1" url="csec.bsi-200-1" /> and thus aligns with <Wiki name="ISO/IEC 27001" url="csec.isoiec27001" />.

Whereas 200-1 only describes general methods for **initiation and management** of an **information security management system** (_ISMS_), 200-2 provides concrete guidance for its practical implementation.
It does so by introducing three distinct **protection levels**, tailored to the specific risk profile of an organization:

| Protection Level     | Description                                                                                                                                                                           | Pros                                             | Cons                                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Protection** | Broad and initial safeguard for organizations just getting started with IT-Grundschutz, with no significantly increased risk.                                                        | low effort, quick to achieve                     | only a low level of security                                                        |
| **Core Protection**  | Targets business processes and assets exposed to specific security risks; focuses on securing what is essential to operations.                                                       | focuses on crown jewels[^crown]                         | may overlook other vulnerabilities impacting overall security                        |
| **Standard Protection** | Classic IT-Grundschutz approach for organizations where security incidents would result in financial loss or productivity impact; assumes sensitive data handling.              | highest level of protection, considers all assets | high implementation and maintenance effort and cost                                 |



## Security Policy
The standard provides guidance on how to achieve these defined protection levels within an organization and outlines how to document then in a **Security Policy**. The policy should include

 - the **scope** of the policy
 - the **security objectives**
 - the **overall strategy** to achieve the protection level
 - the **organizational structure** of the ISMS

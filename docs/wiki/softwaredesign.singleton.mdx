# Singleton (Software Design)

A **Singleton** is an object that uniquely exists for a class: Creating new instances of this class always restrict to this one object.

The **Singleton**-pattern belongs to the **Creational Patterns**<BibRef name="GOF" pp="88-ff." /> and is described in <BibRef name="GOF" pp="127-134" />.

## Implementation
Controlling the creation of object instances and thus enforcing **Singleton**-behavior can be realised through _private_ constructors: clients may not create objects directly using the `new`-keyword [[1]](#new-keyeword), so _public_ object creation is forbidden. Instead, a <GlosRef name="Factory Method" file="sd.factorymethod" /> can be implemented at class-level. The factory method then can hide implementation details and provide means for returning one and the same instance of the class when the client requests such an object instance.

    private static ?Configuration $inst = null;

    public static function ins(): self
    {
        if (!self::$inst) {
            self::$inst = new self();
        }

        return self::$inst;
    }

    private function __construct() {}
}

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ConfigurationTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testInst(): void
    {
        $lft = Configuration::inst();
        $this->assertInstanceOf(Configuration::class, $lft);
        $this->assertSame($lft, Configuration::inst());
    }
}

```

</Tabs>

## Disadvantages
In a larger system, **Singletons** are shared by an equally large ammount of clients, which can be problematic if the
**Singleton** is not stateless and clients change the state of the **Singleton**, which may lead to <GlosRef name="Aliasing Bugs" file="cs.aliasing#aliasing-bug" />.

Also, writing tests for classes that use **Singletons** can be problematic since not only the system is bound to one instance of a specific type: Such tests are then also depending on such a **Singleton** that hides construction details from clients and may also hide dependencies that are hard to conform to in a test system: With a private constructor and a static factory method, injecting dependencies becomes more intricate. Also, mocking **Singletons** is more complicated when they are hardwired with the clients.

Imagine the following implementation of an `AttendanceClock` - whenever a client wants to register a date with the `begin()` method,
the method request the `Configuration`-**Singleton** and uses the `dateFormat()` return-value as the key for the object-level's `registered`-field.

Testing this method would require the test class to make sure that the singleton exists. Also, mocking the **Configuration**-singleton would require to mock the entire class instead of just an instance of it.

```php title="Singleton as Anti Pattern"
class AttendanceClock
{

    public function begin(Date $d): bool
    {
        $format = Configuration::inst()->dateFormat();
        $this->registered[$d->format($format)] = true;

        return true;
    }
}
```

Applying the <GlosRef name="Dependency Inversion Principle" file="sd.dependencyinversionprinciple" /> and using <GlosRef name="Dependency Injection" file="sd.dependencyinjection" /> can help with working around this.

```php title="Singleton replaced with DI"

class AttendanceClock
{
    private Configuration $config;

    public function __construct(Configuration $config)
    {
        $this->config = $config;
    }

    public function begin(Date $d): bool
    {
        $format = $this->config->dateFormat();
        $this->registered[$d->format($format)] = true;

        return true;
    }
}
```

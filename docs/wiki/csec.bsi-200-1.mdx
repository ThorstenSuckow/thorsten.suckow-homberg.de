# BSI-Standard 200-1: Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)

The **BSI-Standard 200-1**[^sources] of the <Wiki name="BSI IT-Grundschutz" file="csec.bsigrundschutz" /> provides guidance on how to establish an **Information Security Management System** (_ISMS_).

It is aimed both at senior management of organizations and those responsible for IT (security) systems.

The standard outlines the general requirements for an ISMS and defines its essential components as:

 - management principles
 - resources
 - personnel
 - the security process, including its conceptualization and organisation

As a **management-focused** framework, the standard emphasizes the crucial role of leadership in initiating and supporting the ISMS, as well as its continuous improvement through the involvement of all stakeholders.
Accordingly, it recommends the **PDCA**[^pdca] lifecycle model for security processes (see <Figure idx={figures.pdca} />) of <Wiki name="ISO/IEC 27001" file="csec.isoiec27001" />, offering structured guidance for implementing, monitoring and refinement of the ISMS in an iterative manner.

The standard explicitly positions itself as a generic framework for establishing an ISMS.
Its concrete implementation is typically guided by risk assessments and further complemented by specifications available with the additional standards of the IT-Grundschutz, namely <Wiki name="BSI-Standard 200-2" file="csec.bsi-200-2" />, 200-3 and 200-4.

### Certification of the ISMS
As <Wiki name="ISO/IEC 27001" file="csec.isoiec27001" /> is the internationally recognized standard for information security management systems, the BSI issues certifications based on the successful implementation of its methodology, referred to as "_ISO 27001 certification based on
IT-Grundschutz_"[^cert].

# BSI-Standard 200-1: Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)

The **BSI-Standard 200-1**[^sources] of the <GlosRef name="BSI IT-Grundschutz" file="csec.bsigrundschutz" /> provides guidance on how to establish an **Information Security Management System** (_ISMS_).

It is aimed both at senior management of organizations and those responsible for IT (security) systems.

The standard outlines the general requirements for an ISMS and defines its essential components as:

 - management principles
 - resources
 - personnel
 - the security process, including its conceptualization and organisation

As a **management-focused** framework, the standard emphasizes the crucial role of leadership in initiating and supporting the ISMS, as well as its continuous improvement through the involvement of all stakeholders.
Accordingly, it recommends the **PDCA**[^pdca] lifecycle model for security processes (see <Figure idx={figures.pdca} />), offering structured guidance for implementing, monitoring and refinement of the ISMS in an iterative manner.

The standard explicitly positions itself as a generic framework for establishing an ISMS.
Its concrete implementation is typically guided by risk assessments and further complemented by specifications available with the additional standards of the IT-Grundschutz, namely BSI-Standard 200-2, 200-3 and 200-4.

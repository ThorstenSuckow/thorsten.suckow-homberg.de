# Spanning Tree (Graph Theory)

If $G$ is a _connected graph_, then the **Spanning Tree** $T \sube G$  is a _minimal connected_ graph with $V(T) = V(G)$.

The edges $E(G) \setminus E(T)$ are called the _chords_ of $T$ in $G$.

## Example

$G$ is a _connected graph_ with $|G| = 7$ and $||G|| = 10$.

import graph from "./img/graphtheory.spanningtree/graph.svg.png";

Removing edges so that $G$ becomes a _minimal connected_ graph. The _chords_ $E(G) \setminus E(T)$  are depicted as curved lines.

import spanningtree from "./img/graphtheory.spanningtree/spanningtree.svg.png";

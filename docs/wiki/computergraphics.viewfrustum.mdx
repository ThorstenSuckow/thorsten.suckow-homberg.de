# View Frustum (Computer Graphics)

A _frustum_ is a geometric shape representing a truncated pyramid with a rectangular base[^frustum].
In Computer Graphics, it denotes the viewing region of a camera that defines the visible portion  of a scene (<BibRef name="RTR" pp="11" />).
Therefore, it is also referred to as the **view volume** (<BibRef name="PJH23" pp="7" />).

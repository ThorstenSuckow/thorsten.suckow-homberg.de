**CIA Triad** is an umbrella term used in Information Security that refers to three core security objectives **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, **Availability**.
These objectives are commonly defined as follows[^definitions]:

### Confidentiality
 - Meaning: Prevention of unauthorized access to information. Exchanged data remains confidential between the communicating entities; unauthorized entities cannot read or interpret the data, even if intercepted.
 - Risk examples: A third party reads unencrypted email content in plaintext; intercepted TCP/IP packets are exposed; stolen data is sold on the black market.


### Integrity
 - Meaning: Protection against unauthorized modification of data. Information remains unchanged unless authorized by authenticated entities.
 - Risk examples: Individual data is accidentally or maliciously deleted; emails are intercepted and their content modified.


### Availability
 - Meaning: Ensuring consistent and reliable access to data. A system's availability must not be compromised by external factors.
 - Risk examples: Data lost due to technical failure or force majeure; malicious attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) disrupt connectivity.

## CIA+
While **CIA** forms the foundation for secure information systems, modern frameworks often include **Authenticity**. As such, the term **CIA** was coined, whereas **Authenticity** is commonly defined as follows:

### Authenticity
 - Meaning: The information originates from a legitimate, uniquely identifiable source.
 - Risk example: An attacker impersonates the identity of a customer and places an order using stolen credit card information.

# Culling (Computer Graphics)

_Culling_ describes the process of excluding various geometrical shapes from rendering based on their spatial relation to the camera's <GlosRef name="view frustum" file="computergraphics.viewfrustum" />.

Different techniques apply, such as

 - **Back-face culling**: Enables the GPU to discard triangles facing away from the camera.
 - **Frustum clipping**: Clips geometry against the camera to compute the visible portion, thereby creating new and smaller geometric objects (<BibRef name="KSS17" />).
 - **Occlusion culling**: Portions of the world scenery that are within the camera's view frustum, but occluded by other objects, are excluded from the rendering process (<BibRef name="RTR" pp="840 ff." />).

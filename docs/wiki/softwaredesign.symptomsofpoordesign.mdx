# Symptoms of Poor Design (Software Design)

The **Symptoms of Poor Design** are a collection of symptoms that appear in software systems where poor design choices - or none at all -
lead to hard to maintain and less sustainable software.

They are described in [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)'s book  **Agile Software Development - Principles, Patterns and Practices** <BibRef name="ASD" pp="85"/>.

The symptoms are:

 1. **Rigidity** - The design is hard to change.
 2. **Fragility** - The design is easy to break.
 3. **Immobility** - The design is hard to reuse.
 4. **Viscosity** - It is hard to do the right thing.
 5. **Needless complexity** - Overdesign.
 6. **Needless Repetition** - Mouse abuse.
 7. **Opacity** - Disorganized expression.


> _"These symptoms are similiar in nature to code smells <BibRef name="REF" pp="75-88" />, but they are at a higher level. They are smells that pervade the overall structure of the software rather than a small section of code."_ <BibRef name="ASD" pp="85" />

# Value Object (Software Design)

In **Object-Oriented Programming**, a **Value Object** is an abstraction of a value belonging to a particular domain.

A **Value Object** usually provides access to operations on the value given an OOP interface, or through operator overloading (e.g., concatenating strings with `+`).

A **Value Object** can represent a primitive datatype such as `integer`, `float` or `boolean` as well as more complex data, where the _value_ of the particular **Value Object** is defined through more than one field (e.g., an _address_).

:::info Key aspects of a Value Object
Fowler introduces the **Value Object** in <BibRef name="POEAA" pp="486" /> as an object _"whose equality isn't based on identity"_.<br />
In <BibRef name="DDD" pp="97" />, Evans refers to a **Value Objects** as an object that _"describe[s] some characteristic of a thing"._<br />
Ward Cunningham relates the _Whole Value (a.k.a. Value Object)_ to a concept that represents not a _thing_, [_"but measures of things"_](http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?WholeValue).

All authors seem to agree on the statement that a **Value Object** is not a _thing, but measure of it_, and lay foundation to key design aspects of a**Value Object** with: **Equality**, **Shareability**, **Immutability**.
:::


## Values as Objects

Treating values as objects is already fundamental to many programming languages, such as **Java**, where the class [java.lang.String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) is implemented as an **immutable Value Object**:

> _"The String class represents character strings. [...] Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. [...] Because String objects are immutable they can be shared."_ [[java.lang.String]](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)

## Identity

When designing abstractions of _values_, there is no need to consider the **identity** of a _value_, whereas **identity** in this context refers to the abstraction of an identifier available with the high-level code, such as a field `id`, containing an unique identifier. Such unique identifiers usually help with referring to objects that have a _lifecycle_, allowing to track the state of these objects, and furthermore reconstitute it through various instances of a software system.

**Value Objects** do not have such an identity, since their identity is of no interest to the client, as their inherent _value_ is solely used for _measurement_ or _description_.

A _money value_ may exist to _describe_ the financial worth of something. An _address value_ may exist to describe the residence of a person. If the person moves, the address of the person moves with this person. If the financial worth of a company changes, the value reflecting the worth gets updated. In both cases, these values do not have to be uniquely identifiable.

:::tip Is Address a Value Object?
I provide a use case where `Address` as **Value Object** is meaningful iin the given context. Also, Eric Evans shares the notion that it depends on _"who's asking"_ and reflects on several use cases in <BibRef name="DDD" pp="98" />.

:::info Picking an apple
If I want to pick a green apple out of a set of green and red apples, I don't care about the identity of the apple, for as long as the apple can be **described as _green_**. If I put the apple away, I can always return later and pick another one from the set, preferably one that's green; I don't care if it turns out to be the same one or not.
:::

### Equality
If _equality_ isn't based on identity, then _equality_ is determined based on one or more attributes between objects.

In Java, comparing for the equality of `Strings` is done using the [`equals`](#equals)-method:
```java
String name = new String("Peter");
String firstname = new String("Peter");

// name == firstname -> false
// name.equals(firstname) -> true

```

Here, `name` and `firstname` are _equal_, but not _identical_. When we speak of _identical_ in this context, we refer to the low-level identity of two variables referencing the same memory-address where an object is stored.


:::info equals() in Java
In **Java**, `java.lang.Object` provides a method for implementing equivalence relations on references:

```java
public boolean equals(Object obj);
```

Specifics of `java.lang.Object` can implement `equals` to consider attribute-values (_equality based on values_) and
references when testing for equality. [[Java Docs]](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object))
:::

**Value Objects** are used in cases where the identity of objects is not important, but their _equality_. In the given example, the value of the `String`-objects are of interest when comparing them for equality, but not their identity.

The identity and the equality of **Value Objects** are based on the values of their attributes, conversely to an <GlosRef name="Entity" file="sd.entity" />, which can be treated _non-equal_ even if attributes are the same for other **Entities**. This is often realized through some kind of _identifier_: If two **Entities** both share the same value `name="Peter Parker"`, but do not share the same value for their unique identifier, then these **Entities** should not be considered equal.

In the following example, a system requires a model of an `Employee`. Clearly, the identity of `Employee` cannot be based
on the Employee's name, since the same name may occur multiple times in a system. The model needs an unique `id`, so
`Employee`s can be distinguished in a system. Then, the equality is based on `identity`: An object is only equal to another object
if it shares the same reference or if the `id` is the same, which can only exist one at a time in a system.

```php

class Employee
{
    private string $name;
    private int $id;
    public function __construct(int $id, string $name)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}

$personOne = new Employee(1, "Parker");
$personTwo = new Employee(2, "Parker");
```

The system can now reconcile necessary processes with the Person-Data: If "Parker" is about to be transferred to another department, it is important to identify the right "Parker", so the wrong one does not end up in a position he wasn't qualified for in the first place.

**Value Objects** are next to <GlosRef name="Entities" file="sd.entity" /> building blocks of <GlosRef name="Aggregates in DDD" file="ddd.aggregate" />. They are often designed as **immutable objects**.


## Immutability
I follow the notion that **Value Objects** should be [immutable](https://wiki.c2.com/?ValueObjectsShouldBeImmutable).

If $24 \in \N$ is added to $5776 \in \N$, the number $5776$ still exists as an element in $\N$: It does not get accidentally changed to $5800$, because if that would be the case, anything that previously referred to $5776$ would now [unintentionally refer to $5800$](#one-integer) (also, we might run out of numbers in the not so near future). Instead, adding one value to another one yields a new value, reflecting the sum of both values - in this case $5800 \in \N$.

    }

    value () {
        return this.v;
    }

    add (integerValue) {
        return IntegerValue.from(this.value() + integerValue.value());
    }

}

const i24   = IntegerValue.from(24);
const i5776 = IntegerValue.from(5776);
const i5800 = i5776.add(i24);

console.log(i5800.value());
```


:::info The One-$n \in \N$ Universe <a name="one-integer"></a>
_"Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" "Because, they are all the same electron!"_ [["The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum Electrodynamics"]](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/feynman/lecture/)

Based on the postulate of the [**One-Electron Universe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe), we can also postulate that all $x \in \N$ are manifestations of one and the same $n \in \N$ travelling forth and back in time. We'd just have a hard time to provide an accurate implementation of this model in software.

## Sharing

**Value Objects** can easily be used as shared instances for a number of referencing objects.
If implemented as **immutable** and the value of an object-defining attribute needs to change, the targeted instance gets replaced with a new instance, containing the updated state of the attribute(s).
This makes sure that a change to one **Value Object** does not affect all objects referencing this particular **Value Object**.

:::tip Aliasing Bugs
If _**mutable**_ **Value Objects** are [shared](#shareability), <GlosRef name="Aliasing Bugs" file="computerscience.aliasing#aliasing-bug" /> are likely to happen. Making them **immutable** prevents these kind of errors.
:::


## Example


### Money
In most of our computer programs we do not care about the identity of _Money_, but the value representing its _amount_.

The following example implements a `Money`-class (see <BibRef name="POEAA" pp="488-495"/> for a more elaborate example of the design for `Money`). As an immutable **Value Object**, we can not change its `value` directly. Instead, a new instance of `Money` is returned each time we `add()` an amount to an instance, preventing <GlosRef name="Aliasing Bugs" file="cs.aliasing#aliasing-bug" />.

In `Account.py`, each `Employee` has initially the same _salary_. This _salary_ is a shared instance of `Money`. If `Money`gets added to an `Employee`'s `Account`, a new instance of `Money` is created for the `Account`-instance.

Changing the value of _salary_ does not affect the `Accounts` initialized with this _salary_.

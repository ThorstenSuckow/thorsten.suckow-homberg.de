# Higher-Order Function (Computer Science)

In programming, a function is called a **Higher-Order Function**, if any of the following applies:

 1. it takes another function as an argument
 2. its return value is a function

## JavaScript Example

In **JavaScript**, [`map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) is a **Higher-Order Function**:

```javascript

const data = [1, 2, 3];

const f = x => {return x => x + 1};

data.map(f).map((x, index) => x(data[index])); // [2, 3, 4]
```

`f` also serves as a **Higher-Order Function** since it returns a function itself.

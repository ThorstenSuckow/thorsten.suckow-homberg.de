# Bounded Context (DDD)

A **Bounded Context** <BibRef name="DDD" /> is a part of a software system that contains the semantics of a
particular model through which it is uniquely identifiable in a system of multiple models. This also involves
organising team members responsible for the given model and its context, and impacts planning and realization
of associated technicalities and operations.

A **Bounded Context** often evolves with time through deeper understanding of the <GlosRef name="Domain" file="ddd.domain" />s
and through constant refactorings based on this understanding, resulting in distinct models.

Placing a model into this idea of a context helps with structuring and separating it from other contexts, **Context Maps** and **Evolving Order** support
the development and refinement of them, and the <GlosRef name="Ubiquitous Language" file="ddd.ubiquitouslanguage" /> helps with
distinguishing this **Bounded Context** from other ones.

Modules and packages help with maintaining the code base of **Bounded Contexts**, but its meaning must not be reduced
to the physical separation of code.

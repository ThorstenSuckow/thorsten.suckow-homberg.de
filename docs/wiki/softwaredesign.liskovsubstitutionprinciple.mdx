# The Liskov Substitution Principle (Software Design)

The **Liskov Substitution Principle** (**LSP**) governs design rules for object oriented languages and states that _"subtypes must be substitutable for their base types."_ <BibRef name="ASD" pp="111" />:

> _If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2, then S is a subtype of T."_ [Barbara Liskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov), [Data Abstraction and Hierarchy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/62139.62141)

The **Liskov Substitution Principle** is one of the <GlosRef name="SOLID" file="sd.solid" />-principles.

## Example

In languages that conform to the **LSP**, the effects of this principle can easily be reproduced:

```php
    class A
    {
        public function itsName()
        {
        	echo static::class;
        }
    }

    class B extends A{}

    class C extends B {}

	class Client
    {
    	public function process(A $a): B
    	{
    		$a->itsName();
    		return new B();
    	}
    }
```

Here, the `process`-function of **Client** digests an instance of `A`, calls a method on it and returns `B`.

```php
    $client = new Client();
    $client->process(new A()); // A
```

According to the **LSP**, the code must also work if we pass any subtype of `A`.


```php
    $client = new Client();
    $client->process(new A()); // A
    $client->process(new B()); // B
    $client->process(new C()); // C
```

Once we create a specification of **Client**, let's say **ConcreteClient**, we must be careful when overwriting `process()`:

```php
class ConcreteClient extends Client
{
    public function process(A $a): B {}
}
```

Here, the argument type and the return type do not change. Any **ConcreteClient** can be used as a substitute for
**Client**. However, if we narrow the type of the argument down to `B`, PHP quits with an error message befoe running the
script:

```php
class ConcreteClient extends Client
{
    public function process(B $a): B {}
}
```

```
Fatal error: Declaration of ConcreteClient::process(B $a): B must be compatible with Client::process(A $a): B
```

### Implications
The implications are as follows:

 - **Argument-Types may be widened, and must not be narrowed down (_Contravariance_)**

    **Contravariance**: `B < A (B subtype A), A:T, B:T argument types; if A:T < B:T, then T is Contravariant`

    At this point, we are not allowed to narrow the argument-type passed to `process()` down. This is because the
    parent implementation `Client::process()` sets up an interface all subtypes have to conform to: It seems logical at first
    to be allowed to pass an `B` for an `A`, since `B` is an `A`, but any program doing so would break as soon as
    `ConcreteClient::process()` accesses a field only known to `B`, and an `A` is passed instead. Thus, narrowing down
    is not allowed with the given example.

 - **Return-Types may be narrowed down, and must not be widened (_Covariance_)**

    **Covariance**: `B < A (B subtype A), B:T, A:T return types; if B:T < A:T, then T is Covariant`

    Conversely, return types must not be widened. Given our example, any program querying `Client::process()` expects an
    `B`. If that return type would be widened to `A` in `ConcreteClient::process()`, any program that tries to access a field
    specific to `B` would break if `ConcreteClient::process()` instead returns an `A` - which is in fact unaware of `B`.

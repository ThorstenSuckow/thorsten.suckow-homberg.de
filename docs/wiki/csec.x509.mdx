# X.509 Certificate (Network Security)

The **X.509 Certificate** is a standardised certificate format and is commonly used by _Public Key Infrastructures_ (_PKI_) to ensure interoperability between systems.

## Structure

**X.509 v3** is specified in [RFC5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), which defines the certificate's structure as a sequence of three fields `tbsCertificate`[^tobesigned], `signatureAlgorithm`, `signatureValue`.
Notably, `signatureValue` contains the digital signature over the data in `tbsCertificate`.

The following information is typically provided by a certificate:

| Field                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **signatureValue**            | The _digital signature_ of the certificate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Version**                   | The version number of the certificate, e.g. `v3` for an X.509 v3 certificate. Different versions support different fields, e.g. the **Extensions** are only available with v3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Serial Number**             | The serial number is used to identify a certificate. _Certificate Revocation Lists_ (CRL) use the serial numbers of certificates that are revoked. Also helps with search queries. **Issuer** and **Serial Number** uniquely identify a certificate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Signature (in tbsCertificate)** | Contains the _identifier_ of the algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate[^redundant].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Issuer**                    | Identifies the entity that signed and issued the certificate. The value is a _distinguished name_ following [x.501](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.4) specifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Validity**                  | Provides information about the certificate's validity period, i.e. start and end date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Subject**                   | The name of the entity the certificate refers to, i.e. the subject and public key owner (in the same format as **Issuer**).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Subject Public Key Info**   | The public key of the subject, along with the identifier of the algorithm used with the key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Extensions**                | Extensions used with the certificate. Provides flags to indicate whether the extension is _critical_. If an extension is marked as _critical_ and the extension cannot be processed, the validating entity is advised to discard the certificate. Examples of extensions are:<br/>- _Basic Constraints_: Helps with identifying the certificate's subject as a CA<br />- _Key Usage_: The purpose of the public key contained in the certificate, e.g. signing, encryption [etc.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3) |


## Roles and Responsibilities
Signing entities and public key holders have responsibilities in certificate management. The following roles are commonly involved:

 - **Key Generation Authority**:
    Responsible for generating key pairs. May be a dedicated system of the certificate issuer or the chip card of the public key holder, in which case the private key never leaves the secure environment.
 - **Registration Authority (RA)**: Handles registration of subjects requesting certificates, and handles validation of data and identities.
 - **Naming Authority**: Ensures that entities are assigned unique and unambiguous names.
 - **Certification Authority (CA)**: Issues and maintains certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
 - **Directory**: Provides directory services that publish certificates and CRLs.

## Certification Path

<Figure idx={figures.certpath} /> visualizes a **certification path** from a signed document up to the root-CA.
The root certificate is self signed (as indicated by `Basic Constraints: CA`).
The CA issues a certificate for TSP$_1$, which issues a certificate for `entity`.
`entity` signs the `document` with its private key and publishes its public key via a directory service.

A relying party receiving the document builds the certification path starting with the entity's certificate up to the root CA.
The full chain of trust must then be validated to verify the document's signature.

 1. Starting with the root CA, its public key is used to verify the signature of TSP$_1$: Its `signatureValue`-field contains the signature of the `tbsCertificate`-section.
 2. This step repeats with the public key of TSP$_1$ to verify the entity's `signatureValue`.
 3. Only after all certificates were validated, the signature of the document is verified using the entity's public key.

Depending on the context, different validation models apply.
[RFC5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-6) specifies the path validation procedures outlined above in full technical detail.
Additional requirements for constraints in path validation may be imposed by national laws, regulatory frameworks or institutional policies[^bsi].

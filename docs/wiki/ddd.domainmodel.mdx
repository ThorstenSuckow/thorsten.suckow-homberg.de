# Domain Model (DDD)

A **Domain Model** is an abstraction of a (part of a) <GlosRef name="Domain" file="sd.domain" /> in a software system.

Its implementation targets the realization of (complex) use cases inherent to the given **Domain**, by incorporating processes,
workflows, actors and data specific to the **Domain**.

Often, planning and designing a **Domain Model** focuses on a <GlosRef name="Core Domain" file="ddd.coredomain" /> that was exposed with the help of  <GlosRef name="Domain Driven Design" file="ddd.domaindrivendesign" />.

When designing **Domain Models**, it is suggested to align logic, constraints and invariants close to the implementation of such a **Domain Model**: This is what _Fowler at. al._ call a **Rich Domain Model**, that is _"better for complex logic"_ <BibRef name="POEAA" pp="117" />.
Conversely, **Domain Models** that contain little or no domain logic have a risk to become <GlosRef name="Anemic Domain Models" file="ddd.anemicdomainmodel" />, e.g. models that serve mainly as OO-representations for relational database models.

> _"A Domain Model creates a web of interconnected objects, where each object represents some meaningful individual, [...]"._ <BibRef name="POEAA" pp="116" />

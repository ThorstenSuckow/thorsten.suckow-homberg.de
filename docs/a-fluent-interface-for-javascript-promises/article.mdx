A Fluent Interface is an OOP API using method chaining to increase code legibility. This article explains how to transform JavaScript Promises into more readable code blocks without the constant use of `then()`.

We’ll be seeing the term **Promise** in this article quite often. Here’s what it means:

> _A JavaScript Promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asnychronous operation. ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise))_

The **Promise**-API is part of JavaScript since the [6th Edition of ECMAScript](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/), better known as **ECMAScript 2015** or **ES6**. There are a lot of articles introducing the API, so I do not want to go into too much detail about it here: But if you feel like you need to catch up on things, I recommend reading through the following:

-   [The Promise Object (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
-   [Understanding Promises in JavaScript](https://betterprogramming.pub/understanding-promises-in-javascript-13d99df067c1)
-   [ECMAScript 2022 Language Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/control-abstraction-objects.html#sec-promise-objects)

_This article and the source code examples assume that you’re familiar with Promises._


## Know your tools

The Promise-API was something I took a deep dive in when I found myself in the process of refactoring and migrating the complete code base of my [**Sencha** / **ExtJS**](http://sencha.com) / JavaScript related projects ([**coon.js**](http://github.com/coon-js), [**conjoon**](http://github.com/conjoon), [**l8js**](http://github.com/l8js/l8)) to [NPM](http://npmjs.org) in 2021. Automated dependency management is something I wish we had back in the early 2000s (hello, [Pear](http://pear.php.net)!). I guess the handy work involved with web development back then is responsible for making me feel like that hotshot-knowitall-1337-hacker when I _i — save-dev_ some random package nowadays. And I want my codebase to reflect the modern environment it’s used in, of course.

As with all things that gain your attention (especially if you have more important things to do; also known as _procrastination_), I got distracted by the tooling. And to ease the process of setting up browser based tests with [**Siesta**](http://bryntum.com/products/siesta) **(**[**Mats Bryntse**](https://medium.com/u/f5a860f1d70d), [Bryntum](http://bryntum.com)**)**, I introduced [@coon-js/siesta-lib-helper](http://npmjs.org/@coon-js/siesta-lib-helper): A NPM-package that provides **easy scaffolding** and **reusable boilerplate-code** for UI/Unit-tests for ExtJS-based projects.

If you’re familiar with Sencha and the ExtJS-framework, you will know that setting up the environment for UI tests can be quite a hassle when using the classic- and/or modern-toolkit, especially since Sencha does not provide dependency management in a way you’d expect from an [enterprise-ready JavaScript framework](https://www.sencha.com/blog/enterprise-in-the-era-of-ext-js-7-x/) in 2021. But once you've grown accustomed to the pattern of writing tests for it you get a feeling for what needs to be put where for creating a functional testing environment with the right tools…

> _While a more robust product comes with more to learn, once you know it, productivity increases rapidly. ([Sencha](https://www.sencha.com/blog/enterprise-in-the-era-of-ext-js-7-x/))_

To get to the point: I wanted my browser based test suites to be magically bootstrapped, and this magic should get profanely applied by an automated process. Sometimes, magic needs to happen asynchronously, so the code had to use Promises (what else than a mere promise would a wish involving magic be?).

And while this approach eliminated almost completely the tedious re-creation of callback hell, I was wondering: Is there a way of getting rid of the - then again - (pun intended) tedious task of explicitly typing `then` and passing `onFulfilled`- and `onRejected`-callbacks as arguments each time I wanted to add another asynchronous task to the Promise chain? How could I make the **somewhat fluent** interface **more liquid**?

## Fluent Interfaces

[Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/) coined the term [**Fluent Interface**](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html) along with [Eric Evans](https://twitter.com/ericevans0) back in 2005. On his website, he describes the concept – or design approach – fittingly with _the API is primarily designed to be readable and to flow_. And while fluent interfaces were not invented by Evans nor Fowler, they took care of proper naming and describing the concept to the world.

> _The API is primarily designed to be readable and to flow. (Martin Fowler)_

A fluent interface is a **speakable API**, and I think most of the readers have come across a fluent interface in their time as a programmer. Take for an example the following code which is part of the query builder of [**Doctrine**](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.9/reference/query-builder.html):

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    title={"Now that’s what we call a fluent interface!"}
    figure={"Source 2"}
>
    <Gist id="3a85db5f22863cbd99fd9f0561f8e167" />
</Embed>

While it is totally valid to write the query like

    title={"The same query, in a different variant."}
    figure={"Source 3"}
>
    <Gist id="c065de310b0d4948044a23dd6726235b" />
</Embed>

…the first example chains all the methods and does not break the flow of reading the code. While providing a fluent interface does not necessarily provide a functional benefit, it is definitely a more convenient approach for developers when investigating the sources.

> _A fluent interface forces you to think about what kind of functionality you should break down into smaller functional pieces._

One might want to differ regarding the missing functional benefit. Of course, implementing a [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) forces you to think about what kind of functionality you should break down into smaller functional pieces, and therefor expose to the public API. It also adds a grammar to an API, and that helps making its usage in vendor code less error prone. [Domain Specific Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) come to mind, and I recommend to read up on what [Fowler has to say about it](https://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html), if you’re interested.

Now imagine writing Promise Chains like this: Instead of using `then()` as a [**Higher Order Function**](http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions) (where we are passing the `onFulfilled`- and `onRejected`_-_callbacks  as the arguments)

<Embed
    modeAware={false}

    <Gist id="976fb5137941b9b56e6d8021e2857f17" />
</Embed>
we want to write the code like this:

    figure={"Source 5"}
>
    <Gist id="03bd6c9debf2a94b4e8a24c4864370a1" />
</Embed>

That should be fairly easy, right? As of the specifications we know that `then()` returns a Promise (-object!) so we should be good with implementing `request()`, `anotherRequest()`  and `validateResponse()`as methods that itself return Promises. We should be able to chain them out of the box. Sounds reasonable. Oh, if it only was this easy…


## En attendant **Godot**

Our naive assumption leads quickly to a first prototype:

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    title={"This does not look fully implemented, but it’s the best we can come up with after somef time where we’re busy with changing code, re-arranging scopes and looking up solution at stackoverflow, all this while pulling our hair out."}
    figure={"Source 6"}
>
    <Gist id="1f4243a5cf3c263413bbedad47248632" />
</Embed>

There are quite a few problems we stumble upon with this approach. First of, we still would like the code to behave asynchronously. This is why we need to implement the `request()`-method as a Promise, so it is considered as an asynchronous operation that is _thenable_ by JavaScript.

> _If the value is a thenable (i.e. has a then()-method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state; otherwise, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value. ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise))_

This is how Promises work. They return a Promise itself, indicating the state they’re in (one of `_pending_`, `_fulfilled_`, `_rejected_`). In no simple, obvious nor elegant way we’ll be able to chain one of the members of the given `Chain`-object to our initial Promise returned by `request()`.

_“Hold on”_, I hear you say, _“I have seen how Promises return another value than a Promise”_. You’re somewhat right - you’re probably speaking of the value that was submitted to the resolver (first argument passed to the _executor_ of the Promise), while passing that Promise to the `await` expression.

import PromiseApi from "./img/PromiseApi.png";

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    figure={2}
    title={
        "Quick catch-up on the Promise API: The argument passed to the constructor is the so called “executor”, which in turn provides two function arguments to control the state (fulfilled, rejected) of the Promise. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">[MDN]</a>"
}>

</Embed>

> _If a Promise is passed to an await expression, it waits for the Promise to be fulfilled and returns the fulfilled value. ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await))_

Let’s shed some light on this. Here’s some asynchronous code we’ll be refactoring in a second:

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    title={"A typical Promise in its natural habitat. Note how we use setTimeout() to access `result`: This is required since an immediate evaluation of result would return “0”, due to the asynchronous context the code runs in."}
    figure={"Source 7"}

    <Gist id="6f839d2cc188e9f20b6afeca2f39e383" />
</Embed>


Let’s use `async/await` to fetch the return-value of the Promise inline, instead of chaining the Promise itself by using `then()`:

    <Gist id="f37ce8ae138075fba7a89f6f79d32dd3" />
</Embed>

Enough with the excursus and back to our initial problem: Whichever way you look at at it, there is just no way to properly chain Promises in terms of “Fluent Interface” without fundamentally changing the Promise API itself. And since the Promise API is pretty much locked into the JavaScript engine, this is a no-no. If we could only somehow intercept and redefine the behavior of Promises…



## Deus ex Machina

Design Patterns are a set of contracts among Software Developers. Their _terms_ _and conditions_ allow for an abstraction
of solutions to problems that come up during development, which helps tremendously when facing architectural challenges
(“architectural” not in term of DevOps, dear DevOps).

> _In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly
occurring problem within a given context in software design. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern))_

One of the [structural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Structural) that Gamma,
Helm, Johnson and Vlissides describe in [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) <BibRef name={"Gof"} />
(junior devs, take note: that’s a reference work you need to add to your library) is the **Proxy Pattern**: An representative
of another object, providing the same Interface as the proxied object, making it usable in the same way. Although
both the Proxy and the target share the same interface, the implementation can differ to a huge degree: While the
target object queries a database for data, the Proxy might just return cached values, or delegate the calls to the
target, if the cache needs to be updated with actual data. Our use case differs, but in the end, this concept of
proxying an object is what we’re going to use. And luckily, it is already part of JavaScript since
[ES6](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-proxy-objects) as a
[built-in object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy).

## The Proxy in JavaScript

Creating a Proxy in JavaScript is done by calling a **Proxy constructor** with two arguments: The **target object** that should be proxied, and the **handler, implementing behavior and trapping calls** to the target object: The target object gets wrapped by another object — a common concept that a lot of the [structural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern) share.

import ProxyConstructor from "./img/proxyconstructor.png";

    <img src={ProxyConstructor}  />
</Embed>


Now you might wonder where the additional abstraction layer can be found, since we have seen that the Proxy and the target object share the same public API. After all, the Proxy must be aware of the [contract it has to fulfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) to comply with the interface of the target object, right?

Proxies in JavaScript work different: JavaScript is not a class-based OO-language - it’s missing the concept of abstract classes and interfaces. It is loosely typed and although it was invented to ride along with the hip bandwagon named **Java** back in the days - it somewhat _looks_ like it, it sometimes _feels_ like it (looking at its syntax),
but it simply is not Java.

In JavaScript, calls being **trapped** by a Proxy’s **handler**, making it possible to virtually extend the target object with logic, provided that the behavior for those calls is implemented in the handler itself. Let’s take a look at an example and get into the details of traps afterwards.

<Embed

    figure={"Source 9"}
    title={"Setting/getting properties of a target object trapped by a Proxy and its handler."}

    <Gist id="353ae80598051b7050049c86c04adc06" />
</Embed>

**Step 1:** We are defining a `target`- and a `handler`-object, both blank with no prototype inheritance (hence `Object.create(null)` — you can go ahead and use the object literal `{}` instead, it wouldn’t make a difference in our example). The handler has two methods — `get()` and `set()`.

**Step 2:** After we have defined both objects, we’re creating a Proxy out of both — with `target` being the target object, and **handler** being the **behavioral** defined.

[get()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy/get) and [set()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy/set) are [**template methods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern) and executed if they are available in the handler. The implementation is up to us (note: this goes for the complete set of [handler functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy#handler_functions) available, of course).

import Get from "./img/get.png";

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    figure={6}
    title={
        "The syntax for get() <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy/get\">[MDN]</a>"}>
    <img src={Get}  />
</Embed>


import Set from "./img/set.png";

<Embed
    modeAware={false}

    <img src={Set}  />
</Embed>



**Step 3:** We then assign a value to `proxy.say`— the setter-call is **trapped** by the `set()`-method defined in the Proxy, executing its implementation.

**Step 4:** The same goes for `get`. When accessing a property of the trapped object, the implementation of the Proxy’s `get()` — method is called.

The arguments passed to both methods provide the appropriate meta-information about the context. In both, we find `target`, `property`, `receiver` — the naming should be obvious, except for `receiver`. To shed light into the dark: Here, `receiver` references the Proxy-instance.

> A Proxy in JavaScript does not magically trap method calls on a target object.

Now, before we get too excited about it — there is one catch: Calling methods on a Proxy. Contrary to the believe, arbitrary method calls on a Proxy would automatically be trapped by some kind of magic methods ([just like in PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php)), JavaScript handles it in a different way.

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    figure={"Source 10"}
    title={"Magic methods in PHP. Calls to inaccessible methods on instances of the class “MethodTest” trigger __call()"}
>
    <Gist id="5001ab2dc0237460186c990cb07fe197" />
</Embed>

Actually, methods that should be trapped by a Proxy must be caught by the `get()`-implementation of the Proxy itself — and return a callable. Let’s see how the PHP example from above works with JavaScript:

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    figure={"Source 11"}
    title={"An implementation of PHP’s __call() in JavaScript. The arguments are not available to the Proxy’s get()-method, since the trap snaps when the method is looked up, not when it’s called."}
>
    <Gist id="27c2630f29f37b5ce86c15b6dcf76604" />
</Embed>

However, the Proxy API allows for a way to also trap method calls, which seems to be a little bit cumbersome at first glance: Let’s have a look at the `apply()`-method:

import Apply from "./img/apply.png";

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    figure={7}
    title={
        "The apply()-method of the Proxy API allows for trapping method calls. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy/apply\">[MDN]</a>"}>
    <img src={Apply}  />
</Embed>

In order for `apply()`to work, we are now passing a `function` as the target, and call the proxy itself as if it was a function. That differs from the previously introduced use case of proxying an object and might be confusing, but we’ll get the hang of it shortly:


<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    figure={"Source 12"}
    title={"Calling a Proxy on a trapped function triggers the handler’s apply()-method."}
>
    <Gist id="e77f8ecbf36463cd5de9554263d2d2a4" />
</Embed>

In the given example, the target is an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) that simply logs “I was not trapped” to the console. It’s behavior gets changed by the `trappedTarget`-Proxy and its handler, which — once called — produces the output “I was trapped”.

So, how, when and where does this make sense?

A trapped function call is aware of its context: The `target` itself, i.e. the original function being proxied, the `thisArg`, which is the object the call is _bound_ to, and the `argumentsList`, containing all arguments passed to it.

<Embed
    modeAware={false}

</Embed>

Forwarding information from the trapped function-call to the original function. We have changed from arrow functions to traditional function expressions to make use of call() and the arguments-object.

Let’s make more sense of it:

1.  We can intercept method calls when that method is looked up on the Proxy — via `get()`
2.  We can use a Proxy for method calls, effectively changing the expected behavior by processing a different implementation — via `apply()`

Both concepts are chained together (pun intended, buckle up!) in the following example. Let this one sink. You should get the idea where we’re heading with this:

<Embed

    figure={"Source 14"}
>
    <Gist id="e934051e2d77779cfeabb8f7c6dd5fa1" />
</Embed>

Here’s what’s happening:
**Step 1:**`trap(obj)`

create Proxy for `obj`

**Step 2.1:**`trap(target).foo`

`foo`is trapped and looked up in `get()`; `get()`returns `obj.foo()` as a proxied function, using the same handler as `obj`

**Step 2.2:**`trap(target).foo()`

The handler’s `apply()` method is called, serving as a Proxy for the foo`()`-method. The original `foo()`-method is available as the `target`-argument. This method is called, and the return value is logged on the console, producing **“The Answer to the ultimate question of life, The Universe and Everything is…”** as output. Contrary to the original implementation of `foo()`, its Proxy returns an object, `thisArg`, referencing the Proxy created for `obj`. If you’re struggling with this: `trap(obj).foo()`takes care of calling `foo` in the scope of the object `trap(obj)` represents — the Proxy.

**Step 3.1:**`trap(target).foo().bar`

`bar` is trapped by the return value of the proxied `foo()`-method (see 2.2. for the explanation) and looked up with `get()`; `get()` returns `obj.bar` as a proxied function, using the same handler as `obj`.

**Step 3.2:** `trap(target).foo().bar()`

the handler’s `apply()`-method is called, serving as a Proxy for the `bar()`-method. The original `bar()`-method is available as the `target`-argument. This method is called, and the return value is logged on the console, producing **“42!”** as output. Again, its Proxy returns an object, `thisArg`, referencing the same object our proxied `foo()` returned.

We have just created a Fluent Interface for an API that was not originally implemented as such. And I think that’s beautiful!

It’s finally time for the Fluent Interface implementation for Promises…


## A Proxy for creating Fluent Interfaces for Promises

The `liquify()`-Proxy is part of [**l8js**](https://github.com/l8js/l8), a lightweight core JavaScript library that skips abstraction layers for the sake of a more lean approach towards functional programming.

The implementation follows the concept showcased in the previous example, where we effectively change the behavior of a Promise by advising the Proxy to trap API-calls in the `get()`- and `apply()` -methods of the handler.

Here’s its implementation:

<Embed
    modeAware={false}
    figure={"Source 15"}
>
    <Gist id="f43426379399d4cc95945f8e7e9a57ff" />
</Embed>


**Implementation Notes:** This variant requires all of our `async` methods to return `this`, i.e. the owner of the asynchronous methods, so that the `onFulfilled`-callbacks forward this exact owner to the next link in the chain without too much of a hassle.

For example, the following will throw:

```javascript
const source = {
foo: async function () { return this; },
bar: async function () { return "somerandomstring"; },
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
snafu: async function () { return "done"; }
};

await liquify(source).foo().bar().snafu();
// will throw an error since "snafu()" cannot be looked up anymore
```

We will step through an example and inspect the various steps to get a better understanding of how this proxified Promise works:

```javascript
const source = {
foo: async function () { return this; },
bar: async function () { return this; },
snafu: async function () { return "done"; }
};

await liquify(source).foo().bar().snafu()
```

**Step 1:** `liquify(source)`
This call will create a Proxy for `source,` with `handler` trapping further calls.

**Step 2:** `liquify(source).foo`
… is trapped by the handler’s `get()`-method. Returns a **bound(!)** function (proxied again by `liquify()`), with `target` referencing `source,` and the `property` being `"foo"`

return liquify(target[property].bind(target))

**Step 3:** `liquify(source).foo()`
The previous call to `liquify(source).foo` returned a proxied, [**bound function**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind). At this point, the method call `foo()` is now trapped in the Proxy’s `apply()`-method. The returned Promise is proxied again.

return liquify(target.apply(thisArg, argumentsList))

**Step 4:** `liquify(source).foo().bar`
Step 3 returned a Promise, so `bar` as a property is now looked up on the Promise. The problem is, of course, that the Promise does not have a property called `bar`. We now have to take care of chaining the `source`-object through, so the following method call can properly resolve to `source.bar`.
We do this by implementing the `fulfilled`-callback. The `get`-handler will check if the target owns a `then`-method and return the following:

```javascript
liquify(target.then(value => value[property].bind(value)));
           ^^**1***^^     ^^**2***^^     ^^^^^^^^^ **3***^^^^^^^^^^
```

-   **1*** the Promise that was proxied in step 3
-   **2*** value is the return-value of the original source.foo()
-   **3*** `property` is known to the implementation of the `fulfilled`-callback when it gets called (see: [lexical scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)). The return value of this callback is the method `bar`, bound to `source`, its owner.

**Step 5:** `liquify(source).foo().bar()`
The apply-handler now traps a callable. Since we have previously returned a Promise, and a Promise is not a callable method, we help ourselves with a clever trick: We are not directly wrapping the argument passed to `liquify` with the Proxy, but rather create function that is called. We “tag” this function with the property `__liquid__` that helps the handler to identify a proxied, callable method:

```javascript
let promise = new Promise()
liquify(promise);
function liquify(target) {
let cb = function () {
return target;
};
cb.__liquid__ = true;
}
return new Proxy(cb, handler);
```

What happens now is that this exact function is processed by the `apply()`-handler: `bar()` calls `cb()`; `cb()` returns a Promise, the `apply`-handler makes sure the `fulfilled`-callback is implemented, and returns the resulting Promise wrapped in a Proxy.

```javascript
liquify(promise.then(value => Reflect.apply(value, thisArg, args)));
                   ^^**1***^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^**2***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

-   **1*** the bound method that was returned in the `fulfilled`-callback implemented in Step 4
-   **2*** The return value of the `fulfilled`-callback, which, in this case, is the call to `source.bar()`
It is important to use `args` here since it holds are the arguments referencing the _resolve_/_reject_-callbacks used by the last call in the chain

**Step 6:** `then()`
The last call in the chain is an implicit call to `then()` triggered by the Promise-instance that was proxied in Step 5. No more links (read: properties) have to be looked up — the chain ends at this point. `then` is a property on a
proxied Promise, so the handler traps it and simply binds the method to the Promise. The expression of the return statement of `async bar()` is returned, which equals to `"done"`.


## Summary

Proxies provide a powerful tool to change the behavior of existing functionality, even when dealing with a [locked API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Cant_define_property_object_not_extensible).

Of course, we’ve merely scratched the surface regarding Proxies. There are still, inter alia, methods like [set()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy/set), [preventExtension()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/Proxy/preventExtensions) or [**Proxy.revocable()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/revocable), which allows for switching off a Proxy during runtime. If you’d like to know more, head over to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), then take your time to read through [A practical guide to JavaScript Proxy](https://blog.bitsrc.io/a-practical-guide-to-es6-proxy-229079c3c2f0), which gives a good overview of the advanced concepts of Proxies. And of course, I’m not the first one who dealt with Fluent Interfaces and Promises. For example, have a look at the implementation of [Ilya Kozhevniko](https://github.com/kozhevnikov)‘s _proxymise_ [here](https://github.com/kozhevnikov/proxymise).

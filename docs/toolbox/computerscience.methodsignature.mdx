# Method Signature (Computer Science)

A **Method Signature** identifies a method. It consists of the method's name and its formal parameter list.


### Example (Java)

In Java, the signature of a method is the method's name and its formal parameterlist[^1][^2].

The signature of

```java
public int intersects(int x, int y, int width, int height) {
    // ...
}
```

is therefore:

```
intersects(int, int, int, int)
```

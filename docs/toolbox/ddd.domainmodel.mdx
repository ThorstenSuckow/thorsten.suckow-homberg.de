# Domain Model (DDD)

A **Domain Model** is an abstraction of a <GlosRef name="Domain" file="sd.domain" /> in a software system.

It's implementation aims at the realization of (complex) use cases inherent to the given **Domain**, by incorporating processes,
workflows, actors and data specific to the **Domain**.

Often, planning and designing a **Domain Model** focuses on a <GlosRef name="Core Domain" file="ddd.coredomain" /> that was exposed with the help of  <GlosRef name="Domain Driven Design" file="ddd.domaindrivendesign" />.

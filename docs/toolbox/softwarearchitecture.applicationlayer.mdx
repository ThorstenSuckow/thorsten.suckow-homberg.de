# Application Layer (Software Architecture)

The **Application Layer** is an abstract functional division in a <GlosRef name="Layered Architecture" file="sa.layeredarchitecture" /> that serves as the interface between the client and layers beneath the **Application Layer**, primarily the software system's **Domain** and **Infrastructure Layer**.

An **Application Layer** mainly digests and validates the client's input, then carries the input out as commands to the
**sub-systems** and **Services** existing in the lower layers of the system, such as the **Domain Layer** often supported by
an **Infrastructure Layer**.

If the results of a particular operation are returned to the client, the **Application Layer** can apply additional
transformation to it, into a format the client understands.

:::info
The **Application Layer** is not to be confused with the **User Interface**: Well designed
**Application Layer**s are agnostic of the interface that is used for generating inputs, e.g. an application server
implementing a **REST Api** is unaware of the client's nature as long as the client conforms to the required protocol.

In a **Layered Architecture**, the user interface would be part of the **Client Layer**.
:::

### Example
In a client-server application, the **Application Layer** would consist of **Controllers** that receive input (`HTTP methods` / `GET`-, `POST`-parameters) and delegate to various services in the layer beneath. Responses are then transformed into _Views_ that are returned to the client. Here, _View_ is an abstract notion: A _View_ is data formatted to a particular structure, such as `HTML` or `JSON`.

The **Application Layer** is often the thinnest layer in a **Layered Architecture**.

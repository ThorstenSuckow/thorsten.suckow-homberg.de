# First-Class Citizen (Computer Science)

In programming, an **entity** is called **First-Class Citizen** if all the following apply:

 1. it can be passed as an argument to another function
 2. it can be returned as a value
 3. it can be assigned as a value

## JavaScript Example

In **JavaScript**, functions are treated as **First-Class Citizens**:

```javascript

const f = x => x + 1;

const g = f => f;

// 1. argument: g(f)
// 2. return value: return f
// 3. assignment: h = g(f)
const h = g(f);

h(1); // 2
```

`g()` serves as a <GlosRef name="Higher-Order Function" file="cs.higherorderfunction" /> as it takes a function as an
argument.

# Application Layer (Software Design)

The **Application Layer** is an abstract functional division in a <GlosRef name="Layered Architecture" file="sd.layeredarchitecture" /> that serves as the interface between the client
and the software system's **Domain Logic**.

It serves mainly for digesting the client's input as commands, which are then carried out by **sub-systems** and **Services**
in the **Domain Layer**. The generated results of the particular operations are then returned to the client or processed
in the **Infrastructure Layer**, or results are computed with the help of such an **Infrastructure Layer**.

The **Application Layer** is not to be confused with the **User Interface**: Depending on the use case, Well designed
**Application Layer**s are agnostic of the interface that is used for generating inputs, e.g. an application server
implementing a **REST Api** is unaware of the client's nature as long as the client conforms to the required protocol.

### Example
In a client-server application, the **Application Layer** would consist of **Controllers** that receive input (`HTTP methods` / `GET`-, `POST`-parameters) and delegate to various services in the layer beneath. Responses are then transformed into _Views_ that are returned to the client. Here, _View_ is an abstract notion: A _View_ is data formatted to a particular structure, such as `HTML` or `JSON`.

The **Application Layer** is often the thinnest layer in a **Layered Architecture**.

# X.509 Certificate (CSEC)

The **X.509 Certificate** is a standardised certificate format and is commonly used by _Public Key Infrastructures_ (_PKI_) to ensure interoperability between systems.

**X.509 v3** is specified in [RFC5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), where the certificate's structure is described as a sequence of three required fields (`tbsCertificate`[^tobesigned], `signatureAlgorithm`, `signatureValue`). Within those fields, the following properties are found:

 - **signatureValue**: The _digital signature_ of the certificate.
 - **Version**: The version number of the certficate, e.g. `v3` for an X.509 v3 certificate. Different versions support different fields, e.g. the **Extensions** are only available with v3.
 - **Serial Number**: The serial number helps with identifying a certificate. _Certificate Revocation Lists_ (CRL) use the serial numbers of certificates that are revoced. Also helps with search queries. **Issuer** and **Serial Number** uniquely identify a certificate.
 - **Signature (in tbsCertificate)**: Contains the _algorithm identifier_ of the agorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate[^redundant].  
 - **Issuer**: Identifies the entity that signed and issued the certificate. The value is a _distinguished name_ following [x.501](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.4) specifications. 
 - **Validity**: Provides information about the certificate's validity period, i.e. start and end date.
 - **Subject**: The name of the certificate and public key owner, respectively, in the same format as **Issuer**.
 - **Subject Public Key Info**: The public key of the subject, along with the identifier of the algorithm used with the key. 
 - **Extensions**: Extensions used with the certificate. Provides flags to indicate whether the extension is _critical_. If an extension is marked as _critical_ and the extension cannot be processed, it is advised to discard the certificate by the entity validating it. Examples of extensions are:
   - _Basic Constraints_: Helps with identifying the certificate's subject as a CA
   - _Key Usage_: The purpose of the public key contained in the certificate, e.g. signing, encryption [etc.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3) 



----------------------------

[^redundant]: redundant to **signatureAlgorithm**, an identifier of the algorithm used to create the signature with the help of the **Issuer**'s private key.
[^tobesigned]: _tbs_ = [_to be signed_](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-5.1.2)

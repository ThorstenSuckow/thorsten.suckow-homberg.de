# Dependency-Inversion Principle (Software Design)

The **Dependency Inversion Principle** (**DIP**) is a principle in Agile Software Development that helps with
decoupling dependencies.

> _"a. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.<br />
   b. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."_ <BibRef name="asd" pp="127"/>

The **Dependency Inversion Principle** is one of the <GlosRef name="SOLID" file="sd.solid" />-principles.

**DIP** suggests that high-level modules should not depend on implementation details of low-level modules. Instead,
**Clients** provide interfaces representing _contracts_ **Servers** need to implement so the **Client** can use their work.

In the following example, **EmployeeRepository** is responsible for fetching the data out of an underlying data storage.

Here, **EmployeeRepository** is the **Client** in the high-level module.

The naive approach is to hardwire the **Server** - the **DBConnection**-class - with the **EmployeeRepository**'s
`fetchEmployee()`-method. This not only creates unwanted coupling, it also exposes the infrastructure
to a layer in the software system that should not be aware of such details.

<UmlEmbed figure={1} title="Information of the underlying infrastructure is available to a high-level module"><Coupling /></UmlEmbed>


```php title="Coupling EmployeeRepository (Client) with DBConnection (Server)"

class EmployeeRepository
{
    public function fetchEmployee(int $id): array
    {
        $db = new DBConnection($this->user, $this->password);
        $row = $db->query("SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id=$id");
        return $row;
    }
}
```

The coupling between **EmployeeRepository** and **DBConnection** now necessitate that every change to the underlying
infrastructure leaks into **EmployeeRepository**. This effectively violates the **DIP** Principle and several other <GlosRef name="SOLID" file="sd.SOLID" />-principles.

To apply the **DIP** to the given example, the **Client** needs to provide a contract for the **Server**: The server's
responsibility now is to comply to the interface by implementing it.

```php title="EmployeeRepository declares the interface, and DBConnection serves the implementation"

class EmployeeRepository
{
    public function __construct(EmployeeTableGateway $gateway)
    {
        $this->gateway = $gateway;
    }

    public function fetchEmployee(int $id): array
    {
        return $this->gateway->getEmployeeData($id);
    }
}

interface EmployeeTableGateway()
{
    public function getEmployeeData(int $id);
}

class DBConnection implements EmployeeTableGateway
{
    public function getEmployeeData(int $id)
    {
        $row = $this->query("SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id=$id");
        return $row;
    }
}
```

Changes made to **DBConnection** in the _infrastructure layer_ don't affect the **EmployeeRepository** now.
Additionally, **EmployeeRepository** can be reused with any **Server** that conforms to the **EmployeeTableGateway**-interface.

In the example above, the **Client** is unaware of the specific of **EmployeeTableGateway**. This information is provided
by configuring the **Client** with an instance of this type. This instance can be determined during runtime, or during compile-time.
**DIP** is often realized with the help of <GlosRef name="Dependency Injection" file="sd.dependencyinjection" />.

# Dependency (UML)

A **Dependency** between a **client** (_dependent_) and a **supplier** ([_dependee_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dependee)) can be illustrated with a **dashed** line with its tail starting at the **client** and an **open arrowhead** ending at the **supplier**.

### Dependency Stereotypes
While there are notations available with **UML** that can be used for other semantics and specifications, or that already imply a dependency (such as <GlosRef name="Associations" file="uml.association" />, <GlosRef name="Aggregation" file="uml.aggregation" /> or <GlosRef name="Composition" file="uml.composition" /> ), the context of a basic **Dependency** can further be specified with one of the following <GlosRef name="stereotype" file="uml.stereotype" /> (<BibRef name="UML" pp="48" /> and <BibRef name="ADU" pp = "288" />):


| Keyword / Stereotype | Meaning                                                                                                                                                      |

| `«permit»`         | The **client** has the permission to access the private members of the **supplier**                                                                          |

| `«substitute»`     | The **client** can be substituted with the **supplier**, e.g. if they share the same type                                                                    |

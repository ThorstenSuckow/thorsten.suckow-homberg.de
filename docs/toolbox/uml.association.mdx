# Association (UML)

An **Association** between entities can be illustrated in **UML** with a solid line connecting the entities that are related.


import CompanyEmployeeSvg from './img/uml.association/company-employee.svg';

<Embed
    figure={1}
    title={"Company is associated with Employee" }
>
    <CompanyEmployeeSvg />
</Embed>



**Associations** in **UML** are used to depict **relationships** and their [**multiplicity**](#multiplicity). Additional information, such as the [**Navigability**](#navigability) or a [**Qualifier**](#qualified-asscociation) or the **role**, can be used to provide further details about the **relationship**.

## Navigability
**Associations** illustrated with a solid line are by default bidirectional: Both entities are aware of each other and can
_**query**_ each entity at the opposite end the line. This inherent **Bidirectionality** can be made obvious by using open arrow-heads at each end of the line:

import CompanyEmployeeBidirectionalSvg from './img/uml.association/company-employee-bidirectional.svg';

<Embed
    figure={2}
    title={"Company can query its Employee. Employee knows its Company. This is the same as <b>Figure 1</b>" }
>
    <CompanyEmployeeBidirectionalSvg />
</Embed>

If an **Association** should not by bidirectional, only one arrow-head should be used at the end of the entity that is
queryable, i.e. which is _navigable_:


import CompanyAddressSvgPng from './img/uml.association/company-address.svg.png';

<Embed
    figure={3}
    title={"Company can query its Address. Address is not aware of its owner (Company)" }
>
    <img src={CompanyAddressSvgPng} />
</Embed>


## Multiplicity

A **Multiplicity** at each end of the solid line indicates the number of associated entities of the given type. The default **Multiplicity** is **1** in the **UML** metamodel, so it is good practice to specify the multiplicity, with lower and upper bounds if required.
Common forms of multiplicities are

| Multiplicity | Description                 | Example                          |
|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `1`          | Exactly one.                | `A` has **exactly one** `B`      |
| `*` (or `n`)    | Any number, including zero. | `A` has **none** or **more** `B` |
| `0..1`       | Zero or one.                | `A` has **none** or **one** `B`  |
| `1..*`       | One or more.                | `A` has **one** or **more** `B`  |



import Multiplicity from './img/uml.association/multiplicity.svg.png';

<Embed
    figure={4}
    title={"A can query B, of which it has at least one. It can have unlimited Bs." }
>
    <img src={Multiplicity} />
</Embed>


## Qualified Association

 **Qualified Associations** are used to provide information about an additional **Qualifier** that is used for
 querying an association. It is _"the UML equivalent of a programming concept variously known as associative array, [...]"_ <BibRef name="UML" pp="74" />

import CompanyAddressQualified from './img/uml.association/company-address-qualified.svg.png';

<Embed
    figure={5}
    title={"Company has multiple Addresses (and at least one). An Address is qualified using AddressType" }
>
    <img src={CompanyAddressQualified} />
</Embed>

## Example

The following **Relationships** between `Address`, `Company`, `Employee`, `Account` should be modelled with **UML**:


 - A `Company` _has_ **at least one** `Employee`
 - A `Company` _has_ **at least one** `Address`, qualified through some kind of Address-type (e.g. invoicing, headquarter and so on)

 - An `Employee` _has_ **exactly one** `Company`
 - An `Employee` _has_ **exactly one** `Address`
 - An `Employee` _has_ **exactly one** `Account`

 - An `Account` _has_ **exactly one** `Employee`


### UML Diagram

The diagram uses the notation introduced above. The *role* `owner` was added to the association `Account -> Employee`
to provide a deeper semantic context of the relationship.

import Example from "./img/uml.association/example.svg.png";

<Embed
    modeAware={true}
    figure={6}
> <img src={Example} /></Embed>

### Implementation

The implementation is rather naive as it forgoes possible infrastructure requirements (as in `Company`'s in-memory
storage of the `Employee`s). Of interest is the implementation of the **Qualified Association** of the `Company`'s multiple
`Address`es: Here, a `Company` _has_ a **Usage** <GlosRef name="Dependency" file="uml.dependency" /> with `AddressType` to
realize the **qualifier**.


```php title="AddressType.php"
enum AddressType: string
{
    case SHIPPING    = "shipping";
    case INVOICE     = "invoice";
    case MARKETING   = "marketing";
    case HEADQUARTER = "hq";
}
```

```php title="Address.php"
class Address
{
    private string $street;
    private string $city;
    private string $country;
}
```

```php title="Account.php"
class Account
{
    private Employee $owner;
    private Money $balance;
}
```

```php title="Employee.php"
class Employee
{
    private Account $account;
    private Company $company;
    private Address $address;
}
```

```php title="Company.php"
class Employee
{
    private array $addresses;
    private array $employees;

    public function getAddress(AddressType $addressType): ?Address
    {
        return $this->addresses[$addressType->value] ?? null:
    }
}
```

### Can `Address`-instances be shared?
`Company` and `Employee` have an association with `Address`, and therefor both of them are associated with "a same **type**", but do
they share the same object instances of `Address`? The diagram is representing a **class diagram**, and the association does not provide further details about the nature of their relationship. Thus, they do not necessarily reference the same instance of `Address` at first, just that they are _associated with instances of this **type**_. It makes no prediction if those instances are _the same_.
This  would rather be an implementation detail of the target system. Here's how implementing it differently can have a severe impact to the system's data consistency, and where further notation with the help of **UML** can clarify its intent.

#### Referencing the same `Address` as an Entity
If `Company` and `Employee` reference the same <GlosRef name="Entity" file="sd.entity" />, both point to **one and the same** uniquely identifiable instance of `Address`. If `Company` changes its _address_, e.g. the `street`-name changes, those changes would be affecting the `Employee` referencing the same `Address`-(id)entity: The name of the `street` where the `Employee` lives changes, too. This is often referred to as <GlosRef name="Aliasing Bug" file="cs.aliasing" />.

#### Referencing the same `Address` as a Value Object
If `Company` and `Employee` reference the same <GlosRef name="Value Object" file="sd.valueobject" />, both reference an **immutable** object: If `Company` changes its _address_, e.g. the `street`-name changes, a new **Value Object** is created and replaces the previous `Address`-Object of `Company`. The `Employee`'s place of residence is not affected by this change, since it still holds the reference to the original **Value Object**.

```php title="Address as Value Obect"

class Address
{
    public function setStreet(string $street): Address
    {
        return new Address(
            $street,
            $this->city,
            $this->country
        );
    }
}

class Employee
{
    public function setAddress(Address $adress)
    {
        $this->address = $address;
    }
}

class Company
{
    public function setAddress(AddressType $addressType, Address $adress)
    {
        $this->addresses[$addressType->value] = $address;
    }
}


class AddressAsValueObjectTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testForReference()
    {
        $type = AddressType::SHIPPING;
        $address = new Address("street", "city", "country");

        $company->setAddress($address, $type);
        $employee->setAddress($address);

        $this->assertSame($company->getAddress($type), $employee->getAddress());

        $company->setAddress($address->setStreet("moved to 23"), $type);

        $this->assertNotSame($company->getAddress($type), $employee->getAddress());
    }
}
```

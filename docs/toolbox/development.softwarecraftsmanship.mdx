# Software Craftsmanship

An idea that reflects on the role and meaning of software development as **craftsmanship**.

Seeing software development as handiwork implies the revaluation of certain inherent aspects formerly considered as important
and those traditionally given less importance, and how this revaluation impacts the individual developer, a software
development team and the process of developing software as a whole.

> "_The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination._" <BibRef name="MM" pp="7"/>

Due to the close connection of computer programs with automatism and technology, the role of software developers are
merely considered supportive. As an example, a written program may exist as a runtime executable or as a utility function
in computer memory and is as such not tangible for the user. The ease of work for a problem domain is appreciated by the
computer's user, but the creator(s) behind the product are just a means to an end: Complex technicalities that a software
support often obscure the fact that behind the written code a person or/and a team exists that successfully applied
their expertise and skills gathered through years of practical and theoretical experience. As an implication to the lack
of appreciation, developers lose the connection to their creation and tend to view their code as a commodity that's
of short lifetime, not of much worth and easily replaceable.

:::info Software Development as Craftsmanship in Literature
Experts in the fields of software development - such as [Pete McBreen](https://www.improvingwetware.com) <BibRef name="SCS" />, the "Pragmatic Programmers" Andrew Hunt and David Thomas <BibRef name="PP" /> and Robert C. Martin <BibRef name="CC" /> consciously connect writing software with the notion of "crafting":

> _"You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, [...]"_ <BibRef name="CC" pp="xxvi"/>

Thomas and Hunt state in the Preface to the first edition of the **Pragmatic Programmer**, that _"Programming is a craft"_ <BibRef name="PP" pp="xix" />
but also acknowledge that software development is usually connotated with the task of engineering:

> _"There should be engineering in software construction. However, this doesn't preclude individual craftsmanship."_ <BibRef name="PP" pp="xxii" />
:::

In **Software Craftsmanship**, **crafting software** facilitated with technical tools and agile methodologies which support diligence and discipline
is seen as a creative process whereas **engineering software** puts the emphasis on technical aspects of the discipline.
Of course, neither the creative process nor the engineering process is less valuable than the other. However, weighing in on
the **creativity** involved in **writing** software allows the developer to forge a closer bond with the product that emerges
out of this process - closer than one would probably expect from an intangible product.

The idea of **Software Craftsmanship** is also reflected in the [Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), published in 2009, expanding on the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/):

>    "_Not only working software,
      but also well-crafted software._
>
>    _Not only responding to change,
      but also steadily adding value._
>
>    _Not only individuals and interactions,
      but also a community of professionals._
>
>    _Not only customer collaboration,
      but also productive partnerships._"

# Software Craftsmanship

An idea that reflects on the role and meaning of software development as **craftsmanship**.

As a result, certain aspects of software development are given more weight, such as the relationship between the individual
developer and her/his code, and the methods and tools used for writing, maintaining and enhancing it.

Due to the close connection of computer programs with automatism and technology, the role of software developers are
merely considered supportive. As an example, the written program exists as a runtime executable or a utility function
in computer memory and is as such not tangible for the user. The ease of work for a problem domain is appreciated by the
computer's user, but the creator(s) behind the product are just a means to an end: Complex technicalities that a software
supports often obscure the fact that behind the written code a person or/and a team exists that successfully applied
their expertise and skills gathered through years of practical and theoretical experience. As an implication to the lack
of appreciation, developers lose the connection to their creation and tend to view their code as a commodity that's
of short lifetime, not of much worth and easily replaceable.

To make the developer reflect on his role with more care, experts in the fields of software development - such as [Pete McBreen](https://www.improvingwetware.com) <BibRef name="SCS" />, the "Pragmatic Programmers" Andrew Hunt and David Thomas <BibRef name="PP" /> and Robert C. Martin <BibRef name="CC" /> consciously connect writing software with the notion of "crafting":

> "You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a _craftsman_ knows, [...]" <BibRef name="CC" />

> "There should be engineering in software construction. However, this doesn't preclude individual craftsmanship." <BibRef name="PP" />

Crafting software with technical tools and agile methodologies supporting diligence and discipline is seen as a creative,
valuable process. Out of this process emerges a product a developer shares a close bond with - closer than one would probably
expect from an intangible product.

These views are reflected in the [Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), published in 2009,
expanding on the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/):

>    "_Not only working software,
      but also well-crafted software._
>
>    _Not only responding to change,
      but also steadily adding value._
>
>    _Not only individuals and interactions,
      but also a community of professionals._
>
>    _Not only customer collaboration,
      but also productive partnerships._"

> "_The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination._" <BibRef name="MM" />

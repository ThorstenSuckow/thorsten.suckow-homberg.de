# Separate Query From Modifier (Refactoring)

**Separate Query From Modifier** is a refactoring that helps with creating side effect free functions.

The **Separate Query From Modifier**-refactoring is used to separate a modifier (i.e. some _setter_)
from a query (i.e. some _getter_). Any _getter_ that also calls a _setter_ is usually a good candidate for the violation of the **SRP**:

> _"A good rule to follow is to say that any method that returns a value should not have observable side effects"_. <BibRef name="ref" pp="279" />


:::caution Be wary of the context
If you're using a coarse-grained <GlosRef name="Facade" file="sd.facade" /> that provides access to fine-grained operations,
this Facade is not necessarily side effect free. However, methods with the clear intent to
return **a value** ("intent" as in: documented in its method name <BibRef name="CC" pp="39" />) should be side effect free.
:::


In the following example, **Accounting** queries an **Employee**'s salary. It also checks for an outstanding bonus
the employee should receive and updates the salary with it. The salary is then returned.

```php

    class Accounting
    {
        public function salary(int $empId): Money
        {
            $bonus = $this->getOutstandingBonus($empdId)
            if ($bonus !== null) {
                $this->updateSalaray($empId, $bonus);
            }

            $salary = $this->querySalary($empId);

            return $salary;
        }
    }
```

The method modifies the value before it is returned (or does it?):
`updateSalary()` is called if `getOutstandingBonus()` indicates that if there is a need to adjust the `salary`.

The implications of `updateSalary()` are unclear to `salary()`, right so for the client who is not aware that a call to
`salary()` also updates the existing `salary` with an outstanding bonus.

What if the client expects the method to be more "pure"?

:::note "More Pure" $!=$ "Pure Function"
The client may expect the method to be "pure" in a colloquial sense: For as long as the **Employee** does not get a raise, this means for every `$empId`
always the same `salary` is returned.
Of course, the method will never conform to the definition of a <GlosRef name="Pure Function" file="computerscience.purefunction"/>
given its context.
:::


The method is a blackbox for the client, and given its intent documented with the method name (returning the salary)
one would not expect side effects.

It would be better to refactor this method so that `salary()` simply does what any client would expect it to do: return
the `salary` for the `$empId`.


```php

    class Accounting
    {
        public function salary(int $empId): Money
        {
            $salary = $this->querySalary($empId);
            return $salary;
        }
    }
```

If the client needs to adjust outstanding bonuses, another method can be used for adding the bonus to the `salary`. By
implementing a method with a clear intent, multiple fine-grained actions are processed from a coarse-grained interface:


```php
    class Accounting
    {
        public function paySalaryAndUpdateBonus(int $empId): Money
        {
            $salary = $this->getSalary($empId);
            $bonus = $this->getOutstandingBonus($empdId)
            if ($bonus !== null) {
                $this->removeBonus($empId, $bonus);
                $salary = $salary->add($bonus);
            }

            $this->updatePayments($empdId, $salary);

            return $salary;
        }
    }
```

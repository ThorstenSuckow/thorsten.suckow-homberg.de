# System Driver Types (Linux)

## User Space Driver

When full access to a device's resources is not required, a **User Space Driver** (*USD*) can utilize system interfaces for limited access to the device's memory space and handling interrupts[^kernel-user-space]. 

If the driver needs to access privileged functions, such as [`ioperm()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioperm.2.html) system calls to access x86 I/O ports, `root`-privileges are necessary. 

User Space Drivers offer a restricted alternative to **Kernel Space Drivers**. Their key advantage lies in improved system stability: If a bug slips into the User Space Driver, only the corresponding process is at risk of crashing, not the whole system.

## Kernel Space Driver

**Kernel Space Drivers** are embedded into the **kernel space** and provide full access to a device's memory and I/O ports. They can be statically linked into the kernel, requiring a full kernel compilation whenever the implementation of the driver changes. Errors in the driver itself will most likely negatively affect the stability of the whole system. 

As an alternative, **Loadable Kernel Modules** (*LKM*) allow drivers to be dynamically inserted into a running kernel without recompilation[^lkm-wiki]. System directives such as [`insmod`](#insmod--rmmod) can be used for loading these modules.

LKMs help reduce kernel size and compile times, accelerating development cycles (`load` $\rightarrow$ `test` $\rightarrow$ `unload`).
However, they might introduce a slight performance overhead due to the additional abstraction layer between the module and the kernel.

### `insmod` / `rmmod`

 - [`insmod`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/insmod.8.html) is used for **loading** an LKM into the kernel. 

 - [`rmmod`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/rmmod.8.html) is used for **unloading** an LKM[^modprobe].

The following excerpt from a bash script demonstrates the usage of `insmod` / `rmmod`: The call to `rmmod`
removes the specific module if it was already loaded[^devnull], `insmod` loads it accordingly.

[^modprobe]: The man-pages specifically point to [`modprobe`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/modprobe.8.html) which takes care of unloading interdependent modules  
[^devnull]: while ignoring possible error messages like `rmmod: ERROR: Module is not currently loaded` 

```shell
#! /bin/bash

sudo rmmod ${MODULE} 2>/dev/null

# loads the module
sudo insmod ${MODULE}.ko || { echo "Error loading ${MODULE}.ko"; exit 1; }
```

### `init_module` / `cleanup_module`

Additionally, there exist two functions in the Linux-Kernel library [`<linux/module.h>`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/module.h) that can be used as callbacks when the LKM has been loaded / unloaded for further bootstrapping module functionality, requesting system resources and freeing them, respectively:

 - `init_module`: Called when the module is initialized (`insmod`)

 - `cleanup_module`: Called when the module is unloaded (`rmmod`)


The following listing[^clanguage] shows the usage of `init_module()` and `cleanup_module()`. Take note that
 - `device_major` specifies the major device number[^identity] associated with the device implemented by the module. We set this to `0` and expect the kernel to dynamically allocate a device identifier.
 - [`register_chrdev` / `unregister_chrdev`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/fs.h) takes care of (un)registering the module with the kernel: `register_chrdev` provides information to the kernel which file-operations are mapped to which functions in the specific module. `unregister_chrdev` de-registers this information accordingly.


```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
...

#define MODULE_NAME "myModule"

static int device_major = 0;

struct file_operations module_fops = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    // ...
};


int init_module(void) {
    
    printk(KERN_INFO "%s init start:\n", MODULE_NAME);
    int result = register_chrdev(device_major, MODULE_NAME, &module_fops);

    if (result < 0) {
        printk(KERN_ERR " Failed to register %s: Error %d\n", MODULE_NAME, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    if (device_major == 0) {
        device_major = result;
    }
    ... 
    
    return 0;
}


void cleanup_module(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "%s cleanup start:\n", MODULE_NAME);
    unregister_chrdev(device_major, MODULE_NAME);
    
    ...
    
}
```

# Referential Transparency (Computer Science)

If an expression can be substituted for a value without changing the program's computational result, the expression is **referential transparent**.

The expression needs to be <GlosRef name="pure" file="cs.purefunction" /> in order to achieve **Referential Transparency**.

### Informal Description
let $P$ be the **referential transparent context**, the _Program_, with $P\colon f \circ g$, where $f\colon Y \rightarrow Z$, $g \in Inj(X, Y)$, $f$ and $g$ are representing expressions.

if $\forall u,v \in Y: \exists x \in X: u=g(x)=v \land f(v) = f(y)$, then $g$ is **referential transparent**. Furthermore, it implies that $f \in Inj(Y, Z)$ since  $\forall u,v \in Y:  f(v) = f(v)  \implies u=v$.

A more formal introduction to this topic is available from [_Sondergaard_](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/13416-harald-sondergaard) and [_Sestoft_](https://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/) in [Referential Transparency, Definiteness and Unfoldability](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/peter-sestoft/ref-trans.pdf): <br />
> _"By this, an operator is referentially transparent if it preserves applicability of Leibniz's law, or substitutivity of identity: the principle that any subexpression can be replaced by any other equal in value. "_

## Example

For $x \in \N, y \in \N$:

```javascript

function f (y) {
    return y * y;
}

function g (x) {
    return x + 1;
}

// f(?) = 64
// 64 = 8 * 8; 64 = 8 * 8; 8 = 7 + 1; 8 = g (7); -> ? = 8 || g(7)
f(g(7)) === f (8);
```

# Layered Architecture (Software Design)

A **Layered Architecture** is a design paradigm for putting related functions of software systems into abstract divisions.

> _"The layers architectural pattern helps to structure applications that
can be decomposed into groups of subtasks in which each group of
subtasks is at a particular level of abstraction."_ <BibRef name="POSA" />

A **Layered Architecture** may consist of

 - **Client Layer**
 - **<GlosRef name="Application Layer" file="sd.applicationlayer" />**
 - **Domain Layer**
 - **Infrastructure Layer**

The interaction of a client with the depicted architecture starts at the top: The commands of the client are passed to the
**Application Layer** and processed by the layers beneath it, if applicable. In this model of hierarchical layers,
a layer is only aware of the layer(s) beneath it. This model follows <BibRef name="ddd" pp="68-71" />.



:::info Layer vs. Tier
A **Layered Architecture** makes no predication about the technology used, and whether other layers are hosted next to
layers of a distinct context. A **Multitier Architecture** is more consistent in this regard.

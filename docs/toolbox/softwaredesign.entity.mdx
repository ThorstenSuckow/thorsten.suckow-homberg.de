# Entity (Software Design)

An **Entity** is a specification of a uniquely identifiable (abstract) object and its properties and behavior in a
software system.

**Entities** are considered particularly important in [**Domain Driven Design**](ddd.domaindrivendesign), where they are used
for **Aggregate Roots** in **Aggregates** for representing conceptual wholes as **Domain Objects**, distinguished by their identity.

> "Their class definitions, responsibilities, attributes and associations should revolve around who they are, [...]" [**[DDD]**](/docs/bibliography#ddd)

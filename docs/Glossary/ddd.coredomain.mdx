# Core Domain (DDD)

In a software system, a **Core Domain** is the part of the software that holds all functionality innate to the
represented [**Domain**](softwaredesign.domain), and which is meaningful for the people and the organisation using this software. It holds the
most valuable business logic for the system that defines the very fundamentals of this **Domain**.

All other parts of the software exist to support this **Core Domain** by making sure its logic and operations are
executed as intended: Developers participating in modelling a **Domain** should focus on this _Core_ of the **Domain**
and support its implementation with auxiliary systems.

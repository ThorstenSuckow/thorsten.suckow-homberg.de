# Domain Driven Design (DDD)

**Domain Driven Design** [**[DDD]**](/docs/bibliography#ddd) is a software development methodology that focuses on
the **Domain** of a business with the target to establish an accurate _model_ of this [**Domain**](softwaredesign.domain) and its inherent processes.

**Domain Experts** in the form of Stakeholders, Managers and Business Analysts work closely together with the Software
Developers and establish an [**Ubiquitous Language**](ddd.ubiquitouslanguage) over the time.
Constant improvements of the communication in the project, to the model being implemented and appropriate refactorings
of the software produce accurately and functional complete business processes. [**Bounded Contexts**](ddd.boundedcontext)
make sure that multiple models can be clearly identified given their business processes, and do not overlap.

It suggests architectural structures, agile methodologies (e.g., communication and team management)
and various software design patterns (e.g., [**Repository**](softwaredesign.repository), [**Entity**](softwaredesign.entity))
that can help organisations with introducing **DDD** in their projects.

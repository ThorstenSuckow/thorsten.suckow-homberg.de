# Domain (Software Design)

The term **Domain** in Software Design stands for a business which processes are implemented in a software system
supporting this given business.

Software development methodologies, such as [**Domain Driven Design**](ddd.domaindrivendesign), strongly focus
on the **Domain** of a business to map its processes into software.

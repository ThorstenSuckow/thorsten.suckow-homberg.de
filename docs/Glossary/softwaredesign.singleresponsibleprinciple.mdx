# Single Responsibility Principle (Software Design)

The **Single Responsibility Principle** (**SRP**) is a Software Design Principle that states that there should never be
more than one reasons to change a particular class.

> _"A class should only have one reason to change."_ <BibRef name="ASD" pp="95" />

The **Single Responsibility Principle** is one of the <GlosRef name="SOLID" file="sd.solid" />-Principles.

A design that violates this principle would be a class that contains business logic as well as logic for persisting
this logic, such as an **Accounting**-class: The **Accounting** class is responsible for managing salaries and payments
in a company. In the current design, the class also contains logic for establishing connections to the database:

import SRPViolation from "./img/srp-violation.svg";

<UmlEmbed
    figure={1}
    title={"If the infrastructure changes, Accounting has to change."}
><SRPViolation /></UmlEmbed>

The responsibility for**Accounting** should be clearly to orchestrate payment and salary information, but with the
infrastructure hardwired into the class, **Accounting** now has to change whenever the infrastructure changes.

The following design resolves this violation: The concern of persisting the data is clearly decoupled from the concern
to process the business logic given the context of **Accounting**.

import SRPValid from "./img/srp-valid.svg.png";

<Embed
    figure={2}
    modeAware={true}
    title={"If the infrastructure changes, Accounting has no need to change."}
><img src={SRPValid} /></Embed>

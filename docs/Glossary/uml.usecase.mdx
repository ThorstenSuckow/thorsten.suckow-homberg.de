# Use Case (UML)

A **Use Case** represents a description of a functionality or requirement of a software system.

[**Actors**](uml.actor) are often used in conjunction with **Use Cases** to depict their interaction with the
system from a higher-level perspective.

**Use Case**s solely define _what_ functionality the system needs to provide, technical or implementation details are
usually not part of them.

# Ubiquitous Language (DDD)

A **Ubiquitous Language** is a vocabulary belonging to a **Domain** which a software system represents (or parts of represents).

Establishing such a language helps with aligning the development of a model of the domain with a vocabulary specific to
the Domain. All participants of the development process (stakeholders, developers, domain experts) have the same
understanding of this vocabulary.

It is used for eliminating communication errors and misunderstandings due to the (often complex)
terms of the targeted **Domain** and ease the transition of such a **Domain** into a software system.

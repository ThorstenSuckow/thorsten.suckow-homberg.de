# Ubiquitous Language (DDD)

A **Ubiquitous Language** is a vocabulary established by (software development) teams that provides semantic contexts
of the [**Domain**](softwaredesign.domain) a software system represents (or parts of represents).

Establishing such a language helps with aligning the development to a [model of the **Domain**](ddd.domaindrivendesign)
with a vocabulary specific to this **Domain**, in such a way that all participants of the development process
(stakeholders, developers, domain experts) have the same understanding of this vocabulary (thus, the **Domain**).
Once established, the **Ubiquitous Language** is constantly used throughout the project by all participants.

It is used for eliminating communication errors and misunderstandings due to the (often complex)
terms of the targeted **Domain** and ease the transition of such a **Domain** into a software system.

# Ubiquitous Language (DDD)

A **Ubiquitous Language** is a vocabulary belonging to a **Domain** which a software system represents (or parts of represents).

Establishing such a language helps with aligning the development to a _model_ of the **Domain** with a vocabulary specific to
this **Domain**, in such a way that all participants of the development process (stakeholders, developers, domain experts)
have the same understanding of this vocabulary (thus, the **Domain**). Once established, the **Ubiquitous Language** is
constantly used throughout the project by all participants.

It is used for eliminating communication errors and misunderstandings due to the (often complex)
terms of the targeted **Domain** and ease the transition of such a **Domain** into a software system.

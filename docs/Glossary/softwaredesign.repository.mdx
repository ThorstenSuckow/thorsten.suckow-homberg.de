# Repository (Software Design)

A **Repository** provides an interface for persisting and retrieving data, while hiding the implementation details of
the underlying infrastructure responsible for carrying out such operations, e.g. database access mechanisms.

**Repositories** are considered particularly important in [**Domain Driven Design**](ddd.domaindrivendesign), where the interface of a **Repository**
"communicate(s) design decisions about object access" and "decouple(s) application and domain design from persistence technology".

> A **Repository** mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. [**[PoEAA]**](/docs/bibliography#poeaa)
